            <p class="large-text">What was the problem?</p>
            <p >When I joined a two man team running two coffee shops and a coffee roastery
                with an ambitious goal of becoming a publicly listed company, they struggled
                to find the time to check, compile, and send through the weekly invoice to the external accounting team.  
                This was mainly as a result of the manual process, duplicate work, and using 
                separate spreadsheets stored on people's private accounts. 
             
            </p>
            
            <p >The coffee shop struggled with manual inventory management which resulted in:
                <li class="dark-list">
                    Inaccurate data and discrepancies

            <p class="large-text">The solution</p>

            <p>To tackle the coffee shop's challenges, a customized no-code solution was created using Coda and Documint. 
                This solution seamlessly integrates three essential elements: a user-friendly inventory management system,

                    Weekly stock compilation time decreased from an average 2-4 hours to maximum 15 minutes

        <p class="large-text">Understanding the landscape</p>

        <p >This project was  driven by an ambitious goal rather than seeing a need for a problem to 
            be solved. The entrepreneur, who has successfully established a small coffee shop 
            with one trustworthy barista, saw the manual processes as sufficient.  When he 
            expanded his enterprise to partner with a much larger organization, the need for a 
            inventory system became evident.  The manual processes was seen as a frustration rather 
            than a problem at the time, but an early warning of future scaling issues.
        </p>  
        <p >The first step towards helping the entrepreneur become scale-ready was to understand 
            the challenge and identify the constraints.  
            By spending time in the coffee shop observing the front line shop manager, an initial list 
            of user needs and constraints became evident.  The process was translated into a 
            service blueprint to solidify the current state and resolve the conflicts in perception at 
            an early stage.  
            
        </p>  

    </div>

    
    <div class="column">
        <p class="large-text">Uncovering the constraints</p>

        <p >As there are literally hundreds of tools available, the first step was to uncover the
            most important user needs.

            <li class="dark-list">
                The team only had access to their mobile phones as input devices.  
            </li>
            <li class="dark-list">
                The store manager, a barista by trade, has never really worked with systems 
                thus the solution had to be very intuitive and easy to use.
            </li>
            <li class="dark-list">
                The accounting team had concerns about access to data and enabling theft.
            </li>
            <li class="dark-list">
                Another challenge was the owner's perception that manual processes were 
                "good enough" and that investing in automation wouldn't provide sufficient 
                return on investment.
            </li>
            <li class="dark-list">
                To ease the transition, the solution had to be compatible with Google Sheets, 
                allowing the owner to revert to the familiar processes and tools.

        <p class="large-text">Selecting Coda</p>

        <p >Understanding the needs and constraints, I set out on my search to find the perfect tool. 
            The first tool that looked promising was SheetGo, which would satisfy the need to keep
            everything exactly as it was, only enabling the data to be connected and managed into a 
            central repository that reduced the need to copy and paste data from sheet to sheet.  
            However, this tool didn't provide a satisfying way to allow a non-technical user to 
            enter the data and would still need duplicating the work in order to enter the data. 
        </p>  

        <p>Another alternative that was discarded was Airtable, mainly due to the performance issues and
            limited support of different media and tools. 
            After careful consideration, my tool of choice for this project was Coda.io which was by far 
            the most flexible and comprehensive tool compared to alternatives.  It allowed me to simply copy and paste the data 
            from the spreadsheets (and buttons to export data back into sheets), supported multi-media 
            formats, and had the ability to integrate to third party tools like Documint that allowed me 
            to automatically generate a pdf invoice from the data.  Best of all, I could add a form 
            that would allow the non-technical users to add and view the daily stock.

        <p class="large-text">Lessons learned</p>

        <p>Looking back, the key insight was related to the importance of getting full buy-in from 
            the key stakeholders before proceeding.  Knowing the power dynamics and decision makers 
            was key to the success of the implementation.  The service blueprint allowed the full scope 
            to be taken into consideration.   It took a month before the owner 
            bought into investing in a digital solution and was the longest part of the process.  
            But once he was on board, the implementation proceeded smoothly and
            was ready for initial roll-out within a few weeks.  Both the external accounting team and the barista's on the 
            ground were fully on board and supportive.

        <p> On the downside, while Coda is extremely powerful and very flexible, it is also one of the most complicated 
            no-code tools I've evaluated.  There are limited resources designed to enable a non-developer
            to learn how to use the tool, and I would rate the learning curve as very steep with limited support.  
            Even doing  very basic things that is easily done in a spreadsheet, turned out to be very challenging
            and requiring a lot of technical support.

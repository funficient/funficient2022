            <p >An established compliance business was looking for alternative ways to generate leads 
                after local legislation prevented them from advertising their services.  This meant 
                stagnating growth and a need for a more innovative solution to generate leads. 
            </p>
            
            <p> While their business was established and profitable, they were looking for a way to generate 
                income from their current client database as the majority
                of their services are once-off.  They were looking for a product that would allow them 
                to generate both new leads without advertising and also offer a recurring product.
            </p> 

        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <p class="large-text">The solution</p>

            <p>To solve this challenge, a customized no-code solution offering a fully functional and searchable
                database of non-profit funding opportunities - which was later changed to a tender database - 
                using Softr and AirTable - was designed and deployed within a few days.    
            </p>

            <p>To further leverage the power of AI as business opportunity and cost- and time-saving alternative 
                to the human reviews, a AI chat solution was sourced to enhance the service offering. With the help of AI, a 100 page 
                or more pdf tender document can be translated into a professional looking tender review document
                containing a summary of the contents within seconds.  Where a human reviewing the document can only 
                guarantee a turnaround time of 48 hours, now it is possible to have the results within seconds.

    <div class="column">
        <!-- <h3>the solution</h3> -->
        
        <p class="large-text">Iterate to Innovate</p>

        <p >This project started by looking for ways to turn creating funding proposals for 
            non-profits, which can be extremely time-consuming and inneffective, into a 
            sustainable and easier means of generating revenue.   
        </p>  

        <p >A prototype was designed and demo'ed to an interested business owner.  While interesting, it wasn't 
            what the business owner wanted.  The seed planted, however, and a few months later 
            he requested a similar database, but for listing tenders as a lead generation tool.
        </p>  
        <p >The next iteration of the prototype was designed and presented, this time eagerly accepted.
            After an initial demo and a deeper understanding of the the current workflow, a few changes 
            was made to the interface design to make it more digestable for an end-user.  
            The comprehensive list of available services were also
            simplified into a short list of items in a drop-down menu, refraining from using 
           the compliance terminology which end-users often don't understand.
        </p> 

        <p >The users maintaining the database needed a user-friendly
            interface to add and delete tenders.  To reduce the risk of accidental deletion
             of valuable data, an Airtable Interface was designed that filtered all the expired 
            tenders to more easily delete them without needing to access the database.
        </p> 

        <p class="large-text">Reviews as a service</p>

        <p >Additional to the initial scope of work agreed upon, it made sense to look for tools that
            will summarize the tender documents, which often are hundreds of pages long.  Typically, a tender document doesn't contain 
            an easy to find section with all the requirements to bid.  It often takes hours of reading simply to learn that a business might 
            not meet the requirements to bid.
        </p> 

        <p >It thus made sense to integrate a chatbot and tailor a custom prompt that 
            will enable the pdf to be read and analyzed,summarizing the requirements into a pdf
            report.  The impact is that the usual turnaround time of 48 hours can be reduced to a few 
            seconds and with that a fraction of the cost.

    <div class="column">

        <p class="large-text">Selecting Softr</p>

        <p >I chose Softr as tool of choice for varioius reasons.  Firstly, it's one of the easiest
            no-code tools to master and get started with, and the available design templates are 
            beautiful and comprehensive.  It allowed me to build the initial prototype risk-free as 
            it only took a few hours and purchasing a domain.  Without being able to show the customer 
            the potential they would have probably not considered it as a viable option.    
        </p>  

        <p>Another big reason why I like working with Softr is that I can easily change and map my data.  
            It seemlessly integrates with a number of datasources.  In this case, the customer wanted to 
            use Airtable, which unfortunately means a longer loading time for each page, but it can as 
            easily be changed to SmartSuite or another datasource. 
        </p>

        <p>Softr also is a highly scalable solution, offering a free plan to get started and test it out,
            while offering a range of enticing features to keep customers hooked and wanting to upgrade
            to a paid plan. Softr and SmartSuite is definitely one of the best combinations to build and 
            validate ideas fast!
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="column">
       

        <p class="large-text">Lessons learned</p>

        <p>Looking back, the key insight was the importance of showing rather than telling in order to 
            sell an idea.  Minimal viable product took on a new meaning for me with this project, as Softr
            allowed me to create a fully functional web app within hours.  Having something concrete to 
            discuss with customers greatly aids the productivity and speed at which an idea can be taken
            to a functional application.

        </p>

        <p> Another key success factor was the ability to ringfence a small functional area and be 
            explicit about what is included and what not.  Starting small allowed and focused on just 
            one thing, namely having a database of tenders available to view allowed for a better 
            understanding of the underlying process which in turn enabled for a better user experience design.
            Adding improvements, like the automated tender review, allows for continuous improvements in a 
            gradual way.
        </p>

        <p> The only less positive experience I had while building the solution was related to Airtable's 
            performance.  I usually refrain from using Airtable, and should have demo'ed two versions 
            with different data sources to show the impact.

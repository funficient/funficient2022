                Your privacy is important to us. We are committed 
                to protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information

            <h4 class="left-align">WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?</h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                Non-personal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit 
                this web site to read information, such as information about one of our services, 
                we may collect certain non-personal information about you from your computer’s 
                web browser. Because non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to 
                you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways that we can use or share 
                non-personal information. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="left-align">WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?</h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual, such 
                as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and fax number. 
                We may collect personal information from you in a variety of ways, including
                when you send us an application or other forms; when you subscribe to receive
                a newsletter; when you book a call using Setmore; when you conduct a transaction with us.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="left-align">DO YOU USE COOKIES TO COLLECT DATA?</h4>
            <P class="left-align">
                No, we do not use cookies or collect any data.  We don't make use of any analytics 
                services like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel.  You can always update your 
                browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. 
            </P>
            <br>
            <h4 class="left-align">HOW DO YOU USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                We may keep and use personal information we collect from or about you to respond 
                to your requests, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to 
                provide ongoing service and support. When you subscribe to receive the newsletter
                we store your email address with our service provider of choice.  
                You can unsubscribe at any time, at which time your email address will permanently
                be deleted from all sources we have access to. 

                We may remove your personal identifiers (your name, email address, etc). 
                In this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. 
                Once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information and 
                we may treat it like other non-personal information. Finally, we may use 
                your personal information to comply with a law or regulation, court order or 
                other legal processes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="left-align">DO YOU SHARE ANY INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h4>
            <P class="left-align">
                We will never share your data with anyone without your explicit permission.
                In the ordinary course of business, we may share some personal information 
                with companies that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf. 
                In all cases in which we share your personal information with a third party 
                for the purpose of providing a service to us, we will not authorize them to 
                keep, disclose or use your information with others except to provide the 
                services we asked them to provide.
            </P>
            <p class="left-align">
                We will not sell, exchange or publish your personal information. We may 
                cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting 
                web site visitors who violate our rules or engage in behavior, which is harmful 
                to other visitors or illegal. We may disclose your personal information to 
                third parties if we feel that the disclosure is necessary to protect our 
                rights or property, protect someone’s health, safety or welfare, or to comply 
                with a law or regulation, court order or other legal processes. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="left-align">HOW IS INFORMATION SECURED?</h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational 
                security in order to protect personally-identifiable information from loss, 
                misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorized personnel and third party 
                vendors have access to your personal information, and these employees and 
                vendors are required to treat this information as confidential. Despite 
                these precautions, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not 
                obtain access to your personal information.  We will, however, always inform you
                in case of a security breach.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="left-align"> HOW DO YOU HANDLE LINKS TO EXTERNAL WEBSITES?</h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                We try to limit the number of external websites as much as possible and use 
                trusted partners and service providers.  This includes files stored on Google Drive,
                making bookings via Setmore, and reading articles on People Development Magazine.

                Please note that any information you post in these discussions will become 
                public, so please do not post sensitive information in public discussions. 
                Whenever you publicly disclose information online, that information could be

            <p class="left-align">

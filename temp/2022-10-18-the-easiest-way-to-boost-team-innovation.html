<p><em>Practical tools to cultivate a flexible mindset</em></p>
<p>In a previous post, I addressed <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-does-an-agile-mind-look-like-12f21cb3a20#.tlodd5hyg">what
an agile mind looks like</a>. It contains ten characteristics of an
agile mindset, of which the first is the importance of having a flexible
mind.</p>
<p>Flexibility being defined as the ability to overcome challenges and
embrace change, much like water finding the path of least resistance,
flowing around rocks and other obstacles in it’s way, rather than trying
to push through it.</p>
<p>Traditional (<em>read un-agile</em>) management, however, favors the
pushing through obstacles method over that of finding alternatives.
<em>Following a plan is valued more than responding to change</em>, so
when something unplanned happens, which pretty much can be guaranteed in
any sprint, the team needs to push harder. <em>More</em> hours,
<em>more</em> team members, <em>more</em> resources to get the job done.
More is better, right? As long as we follow the predictable plan.
Wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Less is more. If you want to be creative, innovative and
flexible, that is.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having <em>less</em> defined processes and procedures is more
flexible, more agile.</p>
<p>Having <em>smaller</em> teams with <em>fewer</em> team members
improves communication and are more agile.</p>
<p>Having <em>less</em> resources,yes, that’s correct,
<strong><em>less</em></strong> resources, are more creative, more
agile.</p>
<h2 id="less-is-more">Less is more</h2>
<p>I plead guilty that I too once was a complainer who included
sentences started with “if only”. <em>If only</em>, we had more time.
<em>If only</em>, we had a better tool to do the job. <em>If only</em>,
we had better requirements.</p>
<p>A sure sign of an inflexible mindset — the <em>opposite</em> of an
agile mindset.</p>
<p>Another favorite of this inflexible mindset includes sentences that
blame or justify why something couldn’t be done. We couldn’t do it
<em>because</em>…. Or I would have done it, <em>but</em>…</p>
<p><em>Fact is, what you look for, you will find.</em></p>
<p>I’ve been on a casual reef dive where we were a group of about ten,
and on our safety stop at the end of the dive, a black tip reef shark
unexpectedly and curiously came to investigate these weird looking
school of fish, before whizzing away at the speed of lightning as we
started moving. When we surfaced and started talking about the dive,
only me and one other diver saw the shark.</p>
<p>The rest didn’t see it, because they weren’t expecting it. It was a
reef dive, not a shark dive. That taught me an important lesson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We tend to see what we expect to see.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve also been on dives where we planned to see sharks, and 90–95% of
the time we found them. Similarly, if you need a reason to justify why
you didn’t deliver at work, you will most certainly find one.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-inherently-creative">We are inherently creative</h2>
<p>Proof of our inborn creativity. We are masters to shape the world
around us when we respond to our environments, flowing around the rocks
in the riverbed without any effort.</p>
<p>Inherently we know that it’s easier to find the path of least
resistance, than try to push through. Yet, we choose to mostly use this
creativity to find reasons to avoid punishment, rather than to find
solutions to overcome our obstacles.</p>
<p>If only we turned around our thinking process to look for alternative
ways to do things when our resources are limited, we would improve team
morale, productivity and profitability. Our habits are what stops us
from being more flexible, so if you want a more flexible mindset, you
have to form new, creative habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Habit is the enemy of innovation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To cultivate a habit of innovation, every day practice your creative
muscles by doing something you’re not used to doing, even if it is
brushing your teeth with your left hand. Here are some more ideas to get
you started:</p>
<h2 id="creativity-booster-1-learn-something-new"><em>Creativity booster
#1 — Learn something new</em></h2>
<p>Preferably in a field that doesn’t involve anything you need in your
day job. Improving your current skillset is simply strengthening your
existing brain muscles — the ones that you are already good at using —
whereas what you want to do is to build new muscles — ones you haven’t
used in a while.</p>
<p>I’m currently learning French, a bit of science, and more about print
and graphic design. I’m also learning about the properties of different
foods and what health benefits each have. Before that, I studied web
design and basic photography principles. I also studied digital
marketing methods, coaching, and education best practices to name a
few.</p>
<p>Each time I am involved in a software development project, these
unrelated new skills is what helps me to be better, more creative, more
flexible in my thinking.</p>
<h2 id="creativity-booster-2-make-something">Creativity booster #2 —Make
something</h2>
<p>I’m a book lover, and for years I was engulfed in book knowledge,
devouring any book I could find. The more I read the more I wanted to
read.</p>
<p>And then one day I realized that I’m so obsessed with
<em>getting</em> the knowledge, that I don’t have any time for
<em>using</em> the knowledge. I promptly stopped reading and haven’t
read a book bar some historic novels and short articles (which I’m still
mildly obsessed with) in years.</p>
<p>Instead, I started finding new, unfamiliar problems or projects to
solve, where I had a specific goal and needed to find ways to meet this
goal, but without any of the resources — including the knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s impossible to fall back on old habits if you’re faced with an
unrelated problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, I’m experimenting with making home made soap and beauty
products. I found some recipes on the internet, bought some oils and
other basic ingredients, but tried to source as many ingredients as
possibly by re-using or recycling rather than purchasing, including the
packaging.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*fnA1hA1o5typUNBGBJoABQ.jpeg" /></p>
<p>First batch of soap, curing in an empty milk container.</p>
<p>For example, the ingredients I use are inspired by left-over food in
the house, currently papaya (there are a few papaya trees on the
property meaning more papaya than what you can eat), used rooibos
tea-bags and coffee grounds.</p>
<p>As apposed to buying a bulbine frutescens plant — one of my main
ingredients, which is massively expensive and unavailable — I asked a
stranger living down the road if I can have a plant from their garden.
Not only did I get a more sustainable and cheaper way to produce my
products, I also made a new friend! Win-win.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most satisfying thing about making something yourself, is the
ability to see, touch, smell and use what you’ve made. The added bonus —
it practices a flexible mindset.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="creativity-booster-3-travel">Creativity booster #3 —Travel</h2>
<p>My first overseas trip was when I was in my early twenties, and since
I haven’t stopped traveling. I love how you are bombarded with the fresh
new-ness of an unknown country and learning about the history and
culture of countries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traveling opens your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Travel has been the biggest source of ideas and inspiration for me by
far, and the greatest tool in helping me to become more flexible in my
thinking.</p>
<p>When you travel to a country like Bulgaria or Thailand, where you are
not able to speak the language or even read the signage, you’re forced
to find creative ways to communicate.</p>
<p>You’re also guaranteed that somewhere during your travel, you’ll need
to solve an unexpected problem. Either the accommodation you booked made
a mistake and overbooked you, the transport changed, or you get lost. Or
in my case, a tsunami hit as I arrived, washing away our entire
itinerary, and twice I discovered that the place we booked for a week
didn’t have any Forex or banking facilities close-by.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter how good you plan, something unplanned will happen, causing
conflict with your travel partners that needs to be resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you don’t have to travel abroad in order to be a traveler. At a
stage I didn’t have any money to travel further than about 50km at a
time, let alone leave the country, so I made a point of discovering
something new within my area. I found that what I discovered was as
satisfying, as I came across hidden treasures which I could share with
my friends.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To cultivate a flexible mind,you need to get out of your comfort
zone. Do something new, learn something new. Push yourself.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for being pushed out of his comfort zone, Richard
Branson could still be the shy little boy he used to be. Thanks to
embracing the discomfort of new experiences, he is now one of the
world’s most successful and most loved business men.</p>

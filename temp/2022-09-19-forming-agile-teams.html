<h2 id="book-review">Book Review</h2>
<p><em>The first workbook in a series of four books to practically guide
teams, based on personal experience, through the four stages of Bruce
Tuckman’s group development theory towards high performance. According
to the model, a team undergoes four distinct stages before they reach
optimal performance, first <strong>forming</strong>, then
<strong>storming</strong>, followed by <strong>norming</strong> and
finally <strong>performing</strong>, with a final fifth stage of
<strong>adjourning</strong>. This workbook focuses on the forming
stage.</em></p>
<h1 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h1>
<p>The book is intended as a guide for agile transformation leaders,
specifically Scrum Masters and agile coaches, yet, it is a valuable
resource for the entire team.</p>
<p>Stakeholders, Product Owners and Team Members’ roles and
responsibilities are covered in detail through each distinct phase of an
agile iteration, making it an invaluable resource for anyone who needs
guidance on task distribution and expectations during each phase of a
typical software development project. It removes any grey areas by
clearly defining expectations for standard Scrum roles as defined in the
<a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum
Guide</a>.</p>
<h1 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h1>
<p><em>For those looking for a <strong>step-by-step guide on starting an
agile implementation using Scrum</strong>, this is a much waited for
resource.</em></p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/315/1*9XfA3ZqsA-1umr9ChsArGQ.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The book is filled with practical tips, techniques and even complete
checklists and templates to guide a new agile team member towards
mastery, avoiding common pitfalls during a Scrum implementation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a book of practical answers equally for those new to agile and
more experienced teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>What is <strong>different</strong> from all other agile
implementation books I’ve read is that it emphasizes the values and
attitudes of the agile leaders, not only focusing on the tools and
techniques, making it a recommended read for heart-centered leaders and
teams.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h2>
<p>The book reads like a practical manual and implementation guide, well
structured and logically laid out, making it easy to find the resources
you need when you need it.</p>
<p>Written in plain English, it is an easy read for those familiar with
enterprise organizational structures and ways of working.</p>
<h1 id="i-like-i-wish-i-wonder">I like, I wish, I wonder…</h1>
<p>The abundance of diagrams and visual aids makes it an easy to
implement book. It does not only rely on words to explain concepts,
adding visuals, external resources and references for even more details,
and templates for a comprehensive guide.</p>
<p>The tone and writing style reads like a gentle, down-to-earth
conversation, making it accessible to anyone, from new team member to
share holder.</p>
<p>Most of all, I simply <em>love</em> the explicit focus and practical
examples on the desired attitude when delivering the messages in the
book.</p>
<p>On the downside, it’s written for an enterprise size organization,
making it maybe a bit too heavy for implementing in a small team. It
also assumes that the team already has a structured and stable delivery
process, thus not entirely a match for startups or organizations which
have no defined roles, responsibilities or even processes.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong><em><a
href="http://www.jesusmendez.ca/book/forming_agile_teams/">Forming Agile
Teams</a></em></strong> is a comprehensive guide and welcome addition to
the agile resource library for anyone looking for the practical how-to’s
of an agile or Scrum implementation in a medium to large
organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An invaluable resource and must read for anyone looking for a
practical how-to guide to implement Scrum.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It fleshes out the basics of the Scrum framework, providing tips,
checklists and templates and links to further reading. The best part is
the inclusion of the right attitudes and focus on values such as
humility and respect throughout the book.</p>

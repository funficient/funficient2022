<p><em>One-piece flow in agile teams</em></p>
<p>Following on the concept why <em>small</em> teams are needed to be
agile as introduced in <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-is-agile-anyway-part-2-6a0934681ca6#.bxiwigqm7">a
previous post</a>, this post will look at why these teams should be
<em>cross-functional</em>.</p>
<p>Different teams use different terminology to explain roles. For
example, the Scrum Master is typically called an Agile Coach if the team
doesn’t use Scrum. Same thing, except that it’s not limited to using
Scrum only and includes methodologies such as Lean and Kanban. To keep
it simple, I’ll refer to Scrum and the roles defined in the Scrum Guide
to explain what I mean.</p>
<h2 id="product-delivery-in-a-nutshell">Product Delivery in a
Nutshell</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum
Guide</a>, a Scrum Team is defined as the combined roles of Product
Owner, Development Team and Scrum Master. Essentially, this means that
these people have everything that they need to transform an idea (input)
into working software that is valuable to the customer (output) through
the process of development, as depicted in the image below.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*W06ba_Vwb-z7V91K2Rzy6A.png" /></p>
<p>That’s the process of <em>development</em>, regardless of whether you
are agile or not. The purpose of development is to take an idea and make
something with it that a customer will be willing to pay for.</p>
<p>We also, however, need to understand the purpose of agility, and how
this changes the mindset behind the cogs and wheels of what happens
inside the black box.</p>
<p>Agility is all about delivering value <em>fast</em> and responding to
change (for this post, I’ll only focus on fast). It’s about increasing
your efficiency and your productivity. The faster you can convert ideas
into sold products or services, the more profitable you are.</p>
<p>So the question that that needs to be asked to increase profitibility
is: “How can we increase the speed in which we deliver value to our
customers?”</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Scrum works so well, is because of the
built-in lean principles. So in order to find a possible answer to this
question, let’s look at the concept of One Piece Flow as it is used in
Lean Manufacting.</p>
<h2 id="one-piece-flow">One Piece Flow</h2>
<p><em>One Piece Flow aims to produce one product at a time, as
efficient as possible, from start to finish. In agile, it means that one
complete feature or user story is delivered from start to finish with
the least amount of waste.</em> <em>One Piece Flow essentially is the
same as having a cross-functional team, and here’s why it
works.</em></p>
<p>In a typical organization, or at the start of an agile transition,
the organizational structure might look like process one in the diagram
below.</p>
<p>The Product Owner manages the product backlog from which a team of
designers pick the story at the top and create a design. Once the design
is complete it’s considered “Ready” for the development, which happens
in a separate team, sometimes more than one team depending on the
complexity. Once development is “Done”, it’s handed over to the test
team and once they have verified the software, it’s ready to deliver to
the customer, or “Done-done”.</p>
<p>Another principle of Scrum and agile is to limit distractions, thus
each team has a separate schedule and sprint backlog. A story done by
one team, does not guarantee that it will be picked immediately by the
next team in the value chain.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*LuT6F4YwxAftovnHEfsMUw.png" /></p>
<p>A cross-functional team, however, as shown in Process Two above,
doesn’t have any handovers between the different teams, as all the
skills needed (as depicted by the various colors) are in the same team.
They don’t need a separate Definition of Done and Definition of
Done-Done. There is also no need to wait for a completed story to be
added onto a sprint backlog in the next team down the value chain.</p>
<p>The top line, or Process One, can be compared to Mass Production, and
the bottom line in the picture above, or Process Two, can be compared to
One Piece Flow.</p>
<p>In the following video by <strong>Ron Pereira</strong> from <a
href="https://www.gembaacademy.com/">Gemba Academy</a> he shows why one
piece flow is more efficient than mass production. This is also the
reason why Scrum advises to have cross-functional teams.</p>

Simulation</a></p>
<p>In a team where you don’t have all the competencies and skills to do
the work, you are increasing not only the time to produce the product,
but adding waiting time, thus decreasing your cycle time and thus your
ability to deliver a product to the customer, or receive feedback.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The purpose of having a cross-functional team is to increase
efficiency, which in turn reduces your cycle time. It is not the only
way to increase your efficiency, but it has the potential to radically
reduce waiting time, while increasing trust and communication within the
team itself.</p>

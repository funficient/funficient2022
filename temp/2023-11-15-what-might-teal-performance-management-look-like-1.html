    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>Performance management is a key success factor, together with
structure, that determines the culture of an organization. What gets
measured gets done. How people are rewarded determines how people
behave. This post looks at Teal performance management and gives some
ideas about what performance management in a Teal organization might
look like.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="purpose-of-performance-management">Purpose of performance
management</h2>
<p>The purpose of performance management essentially relates to a single
question, namely: <em>“How well are we doing towards our
vision?”</em></p>
<p>The intent of performance management is to serve as an organizational
GPS. It aims to help you navigate towards your desired destination.
Performance management is your north star. It tells you which direction
to go and guides you back when you get distracted from your goal.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-north-star">What’s your north star?</h2>
<p>Looking at performance management from this perspective makes it
clear that everything starts with a vision and purpose. When an
organization can clearly articulate their vision in such a way that
everyone can see the desired destination, performance management becomes
a useful tool. However, if it’s used as a tool to punish people for not
meeting a goal, it becomes a meaningless activity that results in gaming
the numbers to look good.</p>
<p>When there is no purpose-driven goal to reach, performance management
often has an unintended, negative effect that leads to conflicting goals
and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/15/competition-in-the-workplace/">competition
within the workplace</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-cobra-effect">The cobra effect</h2>
<p>This negative effect, known as the Cobra Effect, is when a
well-intentioned measure results in the opposite effect. The name “Cobra
Effect” is said to originate from a community where there was a large
number of deaths and injuries from cobras. To reduce the cobra
population in an area, and thus the safety of the people, a bounty for
dead cobras was advertised. The unintended effect, however, was that
people started cobra farming.</p>
<p>In many organizations performance measures have a similar, unintended
effect. You might intend for customer service to improve by rewarding
agents for closing support tickets. However, the effect is that agents
rush through calls without adequately resolving the issues, resulting in
a decline in customer service.</p>
<p>Or, you might intend to increase the ability to deliver software by
rewarding engineers for completing features. The unintended effect,
however, is that no one wants to fix the outstanding bugs and although
there are more features delivered, the quality of the system
dramatically decreases. Or, you might reward sales agents for landing
new customers. The unintended effect is that the support and engineering
teams are unable to handle the load, resulting in unhappy customers and
a negative impact on your reputation to deliver.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-rewarding">What are you rewarding?</h2>
<p>The most important question you can ask regarding performance
management is: “<em>What are you rewarding?</em>” The second most
important question is: “<em>What could the unintended negative
consequences of this reward be?</em>”</p>
<p>An organization operating primarily from an orange paradigm rewards
individuals and specifically the high achiever. The unintended negative
consequence often includes competition and silos forming, and the more
introverted hard workers being overlooked.</p>
<p>If you’re really honest, it also may result in skewed metrics and
dishonest behaviour. For example, using the Scrum framework where
velocity is often used as a measure of performance, teams inflate the
estimated cost of delivery to look good. Although they’re not doing any
more work any faster, by inflating the estimates they give the
perception that they are improving. A manager only looking at the
numbers is easily fooled into thinking this team is better than the
other, more honest teams. Unintentionally you are rewarding manipulation
and dishonesty.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-orange-performance-management">Characteristics of
orange performance management</h2>
<p>The Cobra effect is an example of a non-systems approach to reward
systems. It takes <em>one</em> desired outcome and translates it into
measurable KPIs. It doesn’t look at the overall system but rather one
aspect of a system. An organization operating primarily from an orange
paradigm typically follows this approach to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/11/05/extraordinary-performance/">performance</a>
management, the main characteristics being:</p>
<h3 id="individual-performance-focus">1. Individual performance
focus</h3>
<p>‘Orange’ organizations focus on individual performance. Typically
rewards are based on a bell curve rewarding the top individuals compared
to the rest.</p>
<p>The unintended consequence of this approach is that it creates
competition between people and teams. Silo’s form and even within a
single silo of information top performers typically will aim to ‘win at
any cost’. Often, this means making another team member look bad so that
they can look good.</p>
<p>Self-promotion is rewarded. An underachiever who can aggressively
defend their results, hiding their mistakes, are rewarded, while quiet
hard worker admitting their mistakes are punished.</p>
<h3 id="superior-establishes-appraisals">2. Superior establishes
appraisals</h3>
<p>Another key characteristic of performance management within
organizations primarily operating from an orange paradigm is that the
immediate line manager within the hierarchical system establishes and
completes the appraisal.</p>
<p>Line <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/10/17/performance-emotional-intelligence/">managers
complete the performance appraisals</a>, often without input from anyone
else. The unintended consequence is that employees will do anything to
make their boss see them as good performers, often at the cost of their
relationships with their peers. It can result in a subjective rating
rather than a more fair and objective rating.</p>
<h3 id="appraisal-is-a-snapshot-of-past-performance">3. Appraisal is a
snapshot of past performance</h3>
<p>Finally, an organization operating mainly from an orange paradigm has
appraisal discussions that look at a snapshot of past performance. The
KPIs decided at the start of the financial year remain static. At the
end of the year, the manager evaluates performance against these
metrics.</p>
<p>There is little to no room for changes in KPIs during a specific
measurement period. A performance appraisal looks at the goals set out
at the start of the period and compares these numbers to actual
performance. It is, essentially, a time for reflection allowing you to
look back at what you hoped to achieve and what you managed to
achieve.</p>
<p>This looking back allows you to adapt your plan for the next period
and set different goals.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-teal-performance-management">Characteristics
of teal performance management</h2>
<p>In contrast to ‘orange’, a ‘teal’ organization views it as a living,
breathing organism. Each part of the organism is equally important.  The
entire organism needs to be in harmony with the different parts within
the system for it to be able to perform well.</p>
<p>The organization essentially takes on a systems perspective. Within
this system, everything is seen as interacting parts.  Feedback loops
connect the parts to form a well-functioning whole. The system views
each action within the system as input into another action in a
cause-and-effect <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">cycle</a>.
A change in one part of the system has an overall effect on the rest of
the system.</p>
<h3 id="feedback-loops">Feedback loops</h3>
<p>From a systems perspective, there are two primary feedback loops.
There are reinforcing loops or feedback loops that cause change. 
Reinforcing loops promotes growth or decline when the causal
relationship between two elements creates a change in the same
direction.  Then there are balancing loops that aim to keep the system
in its current state – or equilibrium – by having an opposite effect
between the causal relationships.  The balancing loop is what causes a
system to return to the status quo after the change occurs.</p>
<p>To effectively change a system you have to ensure that the correct
reinforcement loops are affected.  And you also need to allow for a
little change to become standard in the balancing loop.  The key to
sustainable change I believe is to make the fluctuation in the balancing
loop small and consistently practice it.</p>
<p>In an organization operating from a mainly teal paradigm, the
organization is seen as one whole with a primary balancing and a primary
reinforcing loop. Each unit within this system impacts these feedback
loops and all the other parts of the system. The output from one part
within the system becomes the input into the next metaphorical link in
the chain. To improve or change the system the reinforcement loop that
will take you towards your desired state needs to be stimulated.  At the
same time, however, changes to the balancing system need to be affected
in small increments.</p>
<p>Knowing that each change in the system affects the entire system it
is also important only to change one thing at a time. Translating this
to performance management, the top 3 characteristics of a teal
organization are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="team-performance-focus">1. Team performance focus</h3>
<p>In a ‘teal’ organization the entire team and organization as a whole
is rewarded for performing well. Individuals are not separated from the
team they are in. For a team to perform well, all the members of the
team need to contribute and pull their weight.</p>
<p>Similarly, the success of the organization considers all teams’
performance. There is not one winner and another loser. Rather, everyone
wins together or loses together.</p>
<h3 id="peer-based-processes-for-individual-appraisals">2. Peer-based
processes for individual appraisals</h3>
<p>Another key difference compared to an ‘orange’ organization is that
appraisals are peer-based rather than decided by a single superior. As
there are typically no bosses in a primarily ‘teal’ organization, the
people you work with evaluate your performance.</p>
<h3
id="appraisal-discussion-turns-into-a-personal-inquiry-into-ones-learning-journey-and-calling">3.
Appraisal discussion turns into a personal inquiry into one’s learning
journey and calling</h3>
<p>As <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/07/30/individual-purpose/">individual
purpose</a> is such a big part of a thriving ‘teal’ organization, the
performance management discussions turn into inquiries into personal
learning journeys aligned to individual purpose.</p>
<p>A teal organization understands that you can’t have above-average
performance from people who are not aligned with their values and
growth. To grow the organization you need to also grow the people.</p>
<p>Performance management typically looks at the whole individual,
including their health, wellness, and relationships outside of work as
this all impacts their performance within the work environment.  Someone
going through a divorce or the loss of a loved one, for example, will
tend to be more distracted than someone without such challenges at
home.  The appraisal discussion essentially becomes a coaching
conversation.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>It’s advised to choose a low-risk, small project as an experiment to
roll out and optimize before rolling out the process to the entire
organization. Only once you’re convinced that this new approach is
beneficial scale it up to other projects in an organic manner.</p>
<p>Here is a rough guide to get from orange to teal:</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-main-feedback-loops">1. Identify the main feedback
loops</h3>
<p>Firstly, understand how the parts of the system impact the whole with
its interactions.  Map out the system to identify the causal
relationships between parts and the core feedback loops.  Know what
causes growth and decline in the system, as well as what keeps it in
balance.</p>
<p>To change the system the reinforcing growth loop in the direction of
the desired change needs to be impacted enough to create a change in the
entire system.  The balancing loop also needs to be impacted enough to
sustain this new change.</p>
<h3 id="decide-what-you-want-to-reward">2. Decide what you want to
reward</h3>
<p>Once you’ve identified the primary feedback loops, decide what you
want to reward. What would lead to collective ownership?  Also, what is
the most important change that will result in a positive change?</p>
<p>What are the key metrics that would allow you to keep an eye on both
the reinforcing and balancing loops for this change and translate it
into organizational behaviors? Identify at least two key metrics that
will alert you as to whether you are growing or getting further away
from your vision.</p>
<h3 id="define-a-peer-review-process">3. Define a peer-review
process</h3>
<p>Finally, define and agree on a peer-review process and how to roll it
out. How will you select the reviewers? Which roles will you include in
the review? What will they be expected to look at? How would they gather
objective evidence? How and where will they record their feedback?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions you might ask to define a peer-review
process. In addition to these procedural questions, also consider
measuring the impact and how values were lived in achieving the
results.</p>
<p>Once everyone agrees on the process it’s time to start using it.
After each appraisal rinse and repeat until it works for you.  The key
measure of success is whether you are better able to adapt.  Are you
better able to take steps towards your vision?</p>
<h2 id="are-you-ready-for-teal">Are you ready for teal?</h2>
<p>Transitioning to teal doesn’t have to result in chaos, and it doesn’t
have to disrupt the status quo.  The question is whether the pain of
staying where you are is bigger than the pain of trying something new. 
It’s been done, and every case study reports positive results.</p>
<p>Are you ready to take a step towards a more teal way of operating? 
Do you need help to diagnose where you are and define a strategy to
transition towards teal?  Do you need a coach to instil a more teal way
of operating in your organization?</p>

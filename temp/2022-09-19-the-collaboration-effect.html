<h2 id="the-secret-sauce-of-winning-teams"><em>The secret sauce of
winning teams</em></h2>
<p>In the <a
href="https://everydayagile.com/an-agile-culture-is-never-boring-6f01a3475397#.vpq6ezprb">previous
post</a>, Ryan looked at ways to alleviate the biggest fear of
Millenials in the workplace, namely boredom. His first remedy to the
problem — <em>collaboration</em> — is something I feel so passionate
about, that I want to zoom into the subject a bit more with this
post.</p>
<p>But first things first — <em>how does this relate to agile?</em> The
answer can be found in the first value of the <a
href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors of the agile manifesto realized that face-to-face
communication is the most effective, and efficient, way of
communication. Emails often get misinterpreted or ignored “by accident”,
and sorry to disappoint you, but no-one reads those long documents you
spent hours working on. Skype and Slack conversations get scanned
through to find only what you deem to be relevant, often skipping
valuable insights and information.</p>
<h2 id="the-busy-ness-snowball">The busy-ness snowball</h2>
<p>These ineffective ways of communication create an ever-growing
snowball of other problems. <em>What seemed to have been an innocent
means to relieve you from your busy-ness, soon is the cause of
it.</em></p>
<p>Increasingly different team members work only on what they deem to be
important, and slowly but surely the team starts drifting further and
further apart without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>Until one day, usually a few days before launch when it’s too
late.</p>
<p><em>Suddenly everyone realizes to their dismay that what they’ve
worked on so hard, can’t be used. All as a result of everyone being too
busy to talk to each other.</em></p>

Bray</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>It’s by no means a reflection of the skills of the people, nor the
quality of the work delivered. But, like the photo posted by Tim Bray on
Twitter shows, two passing unit tests don’t mean a passing ‘whole’
system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is only valuable when it can be used.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="identifying-the-warning-signs">Identifying the warning
signs</h2>
<p>One of the first things I look at when joining a new team, is their
communication patterns. It tells me much of what I need to know to help
them solve their problems.</p>
<p>When teams rely on tools and documents to communicate, or refrain
from meeting, it usually means that there is a problem with the team
communication.</p>
<p>Here are some things to look for, and why:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>A busy calendar</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>An overly busy calendar is an indication of what I call the
‘all-talk-and-no-do-syndrome’. Unfortunately, not very
uncommon.</em></p>
<p>It’s a manifestation of our desperate yearning to connect and
collaborate with others towards a shared purpose — which is one of the
things that makes us really happy — however, it’s the wrong way of going
about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Collaboration makes us happy, but progress and results are what
motivates us.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without time to action what has been decided or discussed, you’re
being busy, not productive. You can only be productive if you take
action.</p>
<p>For each one-hour meeting to be productive, you need to spend at
least an hour thinking of what you want to achieve and preparing prior
to the meeting, and another hour afterwards taking action and
following-up on what has been discussed.</p>
<p>A full calendar doesn’t allow you to take action or think about
solutions. Clean out your calendar and aim for only one or two meetings
per day.</p>
<p><strong>2. An over-busy chat channel</strong></p>
<p>When you’re chatting, you’re not doing any work. So a quiet chat
channel is not necessarily a sign that people don’t want to voice their
opinion. It might be because they are busy working.</p>
<p>A lot of people use chat as a means to <em>look</em> busy. In my
experience, however, the people most active on the chat channels, are
the ones doing the least work.</p>
<p>Chat is convenient to ask questions without having to wait for the
next meeting to discuss a problem with a colleague. On the other hand,
it’s annoying and counter-productive to constantly be interrupted.</p>
<p>When used right, chat is an awesome collaboration tool. It’s good for
urgent, broadcast messages or discussing tasks. It’s not so awesome when
you use it as the primary communication tool, as the moment that the
chat message is out of view, the contents are probably forgotten.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a rule of thumb, when you need input on a thought process, use
chat. When you need action, use email or voice calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. A lot of documentation</strong></p>
<p>When people write down a lot of things, it points to one of two
possible issues — firstly, that the team is not talking to each other,
secondly, that the team is taking too long to implement decisions made,
or a long cycle time.</p>
<p>People don’t read, so stop wasting your time writing up all the
little details. Rule number one of agile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it doesn’t fit on one page, it’s not agile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mindmap or rough drawing is sufficient. Take a photo of the
white-board after the discussion or a screendump of your discussion
notes and post it. Even better, make sketch notes. A picture speaks a
thousand words, and it saves a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>4. “Me” or “I” or “Us” vs “Them” vocabulary</strong></p>
<p>There’s a time to include everyone, and there’s a time to do things
on your own. However, when in meetings people tend to use sentences that
separates them from the team, it’s a warning sign.</p>
<p>Look for responses like “let me look at it” when you ask a question,
or “I will be working on ….” when the previous person in the value chain
is working on something totally different.</p>
<p>Aim for a single <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-is-agile-anyway-part-3-2d2dd47a7c75#.limn3cq6s">one-piece
flow</a> throughout the organization, from idea to done. When the design
team is working a feature that will only be done in 3 months by the
developers, or they’re part of different teams, it <em>may</em> be a
warning sign.</p>
<p><strong>5. No clear targets</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is not a collaborative purpose or goal, there is no need
for collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want people to collaborate, they need to share a goal. People
will only have a conversation when it is relevant to them <em>now</em>.
Building on the previous points, when there is a big lag between the
designers and the developers, they will not have a conversation.</p>
<p>This means that they will need to spend a lot more time documenting
insights and ideas, and that they will only receive feedback much later,
which makes it much harder to change as you first have to remember what
you were thinking.</p>
<p><em>For effective collaboration, make sure that you defined clear
weekly or daily targets for the team, not individuals.</em></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The effect collaboration has on Millennials is that it gives them a
<strong><em>sense of purpose and responsibility to the
group</em></strong> they are collaborating in. — Ryan Key</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look for the warning signs that inhibits collaboration, and act as
much as you collaborate or more. <strong><em>Action without
collaboration is potentially as harmful as collaboration without
action.</em></strong></p>

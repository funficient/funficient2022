    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="the-agile-tribe">The Agile Tribe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go
together. ~ African proverb</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a born and bread African, today I’d like to honor my roots and
the wisdom of Africa in a subject that is so crucial for agility
success. The subject of team spirit. Together-ness. Tribes.</p>
<p>But first, a short lesson on African culture.</p>
<h2 id="a-story-of-tribal-africa">A story of tribal Africa</h2>
<p>When I think of Africa, there are two characteristics that stand out
above everything else. <em>Unity</em> or <em>Oneness</em>, and
<em>Stories</em> or <em>Conversations</em>.</p>
<p>In the ancient African culture, tribes used to live and work together
as one. There were no boundary between you and me. What belonged to you
also belonged to me. Just because you had a different father and mother
made no difference to our relationship, as everyone was part of the same
<em>family</em>, or tribe.</p>
<p>The chief was responsible to ensure the well-being of the entire
village, and when there was unhappiness in the tribe, a fireside tribal
meeting would be called where each person would have the opportunity to
speak in an attempt to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Stories and talking are ingrained in Africa. The tribal meeting would
continue for days if necessary, until each person has voiced their
concerns. Once everyone has spoken, the chief will decide, and everyone
will follow suit and speak and act as one from that point forward.</p>
<p>Fireside stories were also the way that knowledge were passed from
generation to generation. And to this day, relationships and
conversations are part of Africa, with the wisdom in the African
proverbs which I so love.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-be-an-agile-tribe">What You Need To Be An Agile
Tribe</h2>
<p>The particular proverb above is relevant to agile, and how a team can
do more than one person when they believe in the same purpose and speak
as one.</p>
<p><a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-is-agile-anyway-part-2-6a0934681ca6#.9p1d6zh6k">Part
2</a> of this series looked at who should be part of the team and why.
It also introduced the <em>one-person team syndrome</em> — one of the
biggest dysfunctions of agile teams.</p>
<p>To share resources don’t make you agile. Agility takes togetherness
as a team, where everyone speaks and acts like one.</p>
<h2 id="vital-signs-of-agility">Vital signs of agility</h2>
<p>Like the human body consists of different limbs, organs and parts,
each with a separate, unique function, so too an agile team needs to
know each other in the team and understand the function in order to
support each other, lead by a combination of heart and mind. The heart
guiding the where, with the mind guiding the how.</p>
<p><em>Here’s the vital signs to look for to determine the health of an
agile team:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There’s a well-defined <em>shared</em> purpose. The team speaks and
acts as <em>one</em>.</li>
<li>Each team member <em>participates</em> equally.</li>
<li>There is <em>collaboration</em>. Decisions are not made alone and
work is shared through pair-work or delegation.</li>
<li>Each person has a <em>unique</em>, well-defined <em>function</em>.
Everyone knows each others weaknesses, and their strengths.</li>
<li><em>Conflict</em> is welcomed and addressed head-on, without
blaming, shaming or justification.</li>
<li>Stories are shared in a safe space where each person is
<em>heard</em>.</li>
<li><em>Conversations</em> give direction and strengthen relationships.
Knowledge is reciprocal with equal parts listening and speaking.</li>
<li>You work hard together, and you have a lot of <em>fun</em>
together.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You know you’re agile when purpose and culture collide.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Do you belong to an agile tribe? I invite you to join
mine.</em></strong></p>

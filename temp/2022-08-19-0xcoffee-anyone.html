<h2 id="how-hackers-have-a-lean-coffee">How hackers have a lean
coffee</h2>
<p>I publicly vowed never to write anything about agile again a few days
ago. Being frustrated with the lack of interaction or response from the
agile community, I abandoned everything and everyone agile. Obviously
not my tribe and time for me to give up. If what I had to say was wanted
by the agile community there would be more responses, more likes, more
<em>something</em>. But I feel like a lone ranger lost in the
desert.</p>
<p>An utter tech-addict though, I couldn’t stay away and fooled myself
into thinking that going to a hacker meet-up wouldn’t only be
tech-guru’s in one room and there would be no mention of the word agile.
I was wrong. Agile is everywhere. Like the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="its-up-to-you">It’s up to you…</h2>
<p>But refreshingly, this time the conversation didn’t revolve around
agile or code, but interesting real world scenarios and how code is
used. It wasn’t a religion that was being studied, it was simply viewed
as a tool to get results, much like you need an editor to write code.
Which one you use or how you use it is up to you.</p>
<p>How you use agile is also up to you.</p>
<p>Turned out to be the best meetup I’ve ever attended with more
free-thinking and passionate people together than what I’ve met the past
5 years combined probably! It reminded me of my introduction to
technology and why I fell in love with it in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="tribe-and-tribulation">Tribe and tribulation</h2>
<p>I was always outnumbered as one of only a few females interested in
technology and felt right at home when I walked into an all-male group
sitting comfortably in a lounge area with music to go with it and decor
to match the relaxed ambiance.</p>
<p>As everyone ordered a drink of their choice (no one ordered coffee…),
we simply relaxed into dreaming up fantastic worlds where nothing was
impossible and talked about hacks and security and wondered whether
Google has forgotten their mission of making data accessible and usable
to the world as all they seem to use it for is advertising and making
money.</p>
<p>There was no agenda, no structure, no rules. If you wanted to talk to
someone, you did. If you felt like changing the topic, you did. It was
just a bunch of guys (and one girl) who could think of nothing better to
do over Saturday lunch than spend it with kindred spirits talking about
the subject they love most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true meaning of hacking was at play, with my definition “making
the impossible possible”. I loved it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of people I want to work with. People who you can
have a beer with. People who you don’t have to behave professionally
with all the time or try to be perfect. People where conversations ebb
and flow between personal stories and technology, where the human and
the employee is the same person. People where everyone can be
themselves.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, most companies don’t have this and most people
don’t do work which they feel so passionate about that they would spend
the weekend talking about it.</p>
<p>Most people I ask what they’re passionate about can’t answer me. Most
people don’t have a topic they are so interested in that they are start
bubbling from the inside when they talk about it.</p>
<p>I start bubbling inside when I talk about technology, education and
alternative healthcare. I can’t even get all the words out so excited I
get to talk about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What makes you bubble inside?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-privacy">A bit of privacy</h2>
<p>But I digress. Our coffee centered around security and hacking and
the reason why I went there in the first place was because I was hacked
a while ago. I wanted to get into the mind of a hacker and understand
why on earth you would invade someone’s personal space uninvited.
Hacking to me being the worst form of crossing boundaries and a show of
disrespect towards the person you are hacking. If I treated them with
disrespect, maybe I deserved it, but in this case, I felt violated,
breached, taken advantage of. Worst of all, it cost me money unable to
attend to scheduled work.</p>
<p>From the hacker’s point of view, it’s fun. It’s a challenge. It’s
ultimately a search for recognition. Being able to go to one of the top
players in technology having hacked their account is like a personal
badge of achievement indicating you’re better than the best.</p>
<p>I get that. Who wouldn’t want that. I don’t think anyone would mind
getting attention from a top player. But to all the hackers out there —
do you realize the impact on the people you hack? It’s no different from
bullying. Both is taking advantage of the weakness and innocence of
someone else in order for you to feel more powerful.</p>
<p>The question is why would someone not trust anyone else? Why would
you want to build such a big fence around you to keep everyone out? Is
it really to feel safe? Because from my perspective, the people who feel
safe are the people who openly share their passwords with their peers.
The people who feel safe don’t mind being transparent. People who feel
safe trust that the people they deal with has their best interest at
heart. They get the respect from the people they work with because they
trust them. It’s the baddies that mostly need a bodyguard, not the
goodies. It’s people who live in fear that own a gun. People who trust
sleep with their doors open and leave the key under the floormat.</p>
<p>When you don’t trust someone you need to keep secrets, you need to
lock away your passwords, you need to use https and not just http. It’s
also a lack of trust that requires management as a function. If there
was enough trust you wouldn’t need someone to check whether you are
doing your job or tell you what to do. I haven’t met anyone who likes
being micro-managed, so why on earth would you want to willingly break
trust by hacking?</p>
<h2 id="immunity-and-immunization">Immunity and immunization</h2>
<p>Hacking, like all things, is not all bad. In fact, I think there is
more good about hacking than there is bad. Hacking is what turns science
fiction into reality. Hacking is what makes the impossible possible.
Hacking breaks barriers and moves humanity forward. Hacking shows the
weak spots in a system, allowing you to strengthen it, and to be honest,
I wouldn’t mind seeing a lot more hacking for this purpose (and done
with good intention).</p>
<p>An example. I recently had to do an international bank transaction
and what was supposed to be a quick transfer, ended up taking hours and
about 10 printed pages, most of these containing some inaccuracy, yet I
was asked to sign with the wrong information on the page.</p>
<p>When I pointed out that it’s crazy to ask me to sign to confirm my
details but the system hasn’t updated the details, they said to just
sign. It’s procedure. The system will update the information later. They
can’t process the transaction without the signature, even if it meant
that I’m in effect committing fraud signing that my address details are
accurate, which is the reason why they ask me to sign in the first
place. To have proof that I gave the correct details.</p>
<p>The irony is that I was made to fill in three separate forms to do
the same change of address, a triplicate in waste, and still the final
form contained the wrong information. Had I not pointed out part of the
broken process, the person helping me never would have remembered to
make me fill in yet another form, yet they proudly claim to have due
diligence. In my opinion, all they have is unhappy customers, wasted
time and a huge bill to an auditor who obviously isn’t worth their
money.</p>
<p>What upsets me is that the customer is charged exuberant fees for
these inconvenient and inaccurate transactions. The same bank phoned to
confirm the bank details, just to phone me a few days later saying that
the bank information is incorrect. Why people keep paying for these
services that have no point of service to the customer blows my mind.
Why no-one complains I simply don’t get.</p>
<p>In this case, I think a hacker would do the world a favor by pointing
out this weakness to the bank, as they refuse to listen to the
customers. So too I would feel creating a hack to block adds is a
brilliant service and a hack to become anonymous on a browser to stop
Google and Microsoft and all the other companies collecting personal
data from people would be great as they have not proven that they are
using it in our best interest.</p>
<p>But as much as I feel our immune system needs to be strong, I am
strongly opposed to immunization. Strengthening the immune system is
pointing out weaknesses in the systems that is already weak,
immunization is hacking someone’s personal account and breaching trust,
it’s like intentionally breaking the system to get in uninvited, not
merely finding the weak spot. When everyone breaches this trust and
respect, imagine what the world would look like. I sure wouldn’t want to
live there.</p>
<p>So next time before you think of breaching someone’s personal space,
just ask yourself how you would feel if the same happened to you?</p>
<p>Are you hacking for the greater good or for personal power?</p>

<h1 class="title">Why Teams Should Be Small</h1>

<p><em>Size DOES matter.</em></p>
<p>In a post by <em>Steve Denning</em> in an article on Forbes, he coins
the term “<strong><a
href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2016/09/08/explaining-agile/#1e3523c82ef7">The
Law of The Small Teams</a>”</strong>. He claims that in order to be
agile, an organization has to embrace the law of small teams. This post
expands on his viewpoint explaining the practicalities of what exactly
makes a small team agile and why. I don’t intend to restate what he has
already mentioned, so please do read the links to his articles for more
on his perspective.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-small-team-agile">What makes a small team
agile?</h2>
<p>Most organizations don’t start off their agile journey with a fully
autonomous and cross-functional team — one of the characteristics of an
agile team. Actually, most organizations don’t reach this goal after
years of practicing agile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply having a small team does not make you agile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smallness is important of course, but <em>what</em> then makes a
small team <em>agile</em> if it’s not the size?</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-elephant">Breaking down the elephant</h2>
<p>A team, is a group of people with either diverse, or similar skills.
Most organizations I’ve come across organize teams according to skills,
keeping the developers in one team, and requirements in another
team.</p>
<p>But first, let’s look at what <em>skills</em> are usually needed in a
big organization to deliver a product to the end-user — from inception
to end — on a generalized level.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ucJjkC5dx95pGoKFlbuk8Q.png" /></p>
<p>Usually, some kind of analysis and feasibility study is done to
determine what to build. In a traditional organization, this was the
role of the business analyst, sometimes the business owner, other times
marketing or the product manager. In a more agile environment, the role
is the responsibility of the Product Owner. Each organization calls it
something else, but the <em><strong>skill</strong> —</em> not the role —
required is to analyze the business and discover a need that can
potentially result in revenue.</p>
<p>Next in line is someone who is able to make it look good
aesthetically, and make sure it is easy to use. The designer or UX team
is usually responsible for this, sometimes the business analyst, but the
main <em>skill</em> required is that of design.</p>
<p>Then someone needs to look at the entire system as a whole and figure
out how best to design a solution that will technically work well,
without breaking any of the already existing parts. This can be a
dedicated architect, or a senior developer, sometimes the development
manager. Regardless of who has the responsibility, the
<strong><em>skill</em></strong> set required is that of a strategic
thinker with the ability to envision the big picture of a technical
solution.</p>
<p>The developers then drill down and ground this vision into functional
software, using a set of technical skills like programming in a specific
language,TDD, or other skills depending on the technical
environment.</p>
<p>A tester zooms out again looking at the big picture again, making
sure that the integrated parts work well together after it has been unit
tested by the developers. Typically, the <em>skills</em> required at
this stage is a methodical approach to work, high attention to detail,
and the ability to analyze and isolate issues, all while keeping in mind
the customer expectations and needs.</p>
<p>Finally, someone needs to communicate the message to the user and
make sure that what they receive they can use. These people are usually
good with words and writing and typically called a technical writer.</p>
<h2 id="same-same-but-different">Same-same, but different</h2>
<p>Each person has different skills. Sometimes the person specializes
only in one area like programming in one specific language. Other times
a person is good at more than one skill, like programming and design and
maybe architecture design.</p>
<p><em>It thus doesn’t make sense to use a generic role to decide on the
team layout for an agile team. Rather, it makes sense to look at the
skills required for each product being developed. Often, small teams
focusing on roles and not skills will be less agile.</em></p>
<p>An easy check to verify whether your team meets this requirement, is
to ask whether you have all the skills you need in order to deliver a
product?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, it does not necessarily mean that the team is
not agile, but it will necessarily mean that your cycle time will be
longer and your efficiency lower, making you less agile. <em>More about
this topic in a later post.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-one-person-team">The one person team</h2>
<p><em>One of the most common dysfunctions in organizations is what I
call the one-person-team. In these “teams” people share desk space and
they report to the same line manager, but each has their own agenda and
there is as little as possible collaboration between team
members.</em></p>
<p>Typically they will each pick a task and only take responsibility for
<em>their</em> task. When another team member has a problem, they will
shrug their shoulders saying it’s not their problem. They care only to
do what they have to do to get a bonus, or not to get fired. No more, no
less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply putting people together in a small team does not make them
agile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>But what then does?</em> This is best answered with a quick
exercise and going back to the essence of agile, namely that of the
value of having different perceptions.</p>
<h2 id="who-has-the-best-efficiency">Who has the best efficiency?</h2>
<p>When you look at the diagram below, Team A represents a one-person
team, where work is passed in a waterfall approach from one person in
the team to the next. Team B is a cross-functional agile team, where
each person has a different skill-set, with some overlap. Team C
represents a big organization with many products and large teams.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3XyOcaDBoJRAYVU1Je2Adw.png" /></p>
<p>Now, imagine these three teams were to describe what they see around
them to a blind man. Which team has the most comprehensive view, with
the least amount of waste?</p>
<p>If you answered Team B, you are correct.</p>
<p>In Team A, because of the lack of collaboration, each subsequent
person views the story from his or her perspective only. Valuable
insights are lost, and errors or a under-developed skill might be easily
hidden. That might mean that technical debt are being introduced without
anyone noticing. There is typically overlap with two people doing the
same work, and parts not being looked at by anyone at all, but because
they don’t talk to each other, no-one notices until it’s too late.</p>
<p>Their perspective can be described by one person that is only able to
see what is directly in front of them, with little view to his sides,
and none of what is behind him.</p>
<p>Team C, on the other hand, is so crowded, that the people in the
middle can’t see anything outside the circle. A lot of time is wasted
trying to convince each other of their viewpoints, and more confusion
than clarity is created by the amount of varying viewpoints. Or, as per
Jeff Bezos two pizza rule, the number of interactions are too many for
communication to be effective if there are more people in the team to be
fed with two pizza’s.</p>
<p>Even though they should be able to see more, the many contradicting
views results in so much ambiguity that in the end everyone is confused,
most of all the blind man.</p>
<p>Team B, however, each has a unique and valuable viewpoint, with no
obstructions to obscure their view. They are able to clearly see the
entire product, with each viewpoint adding a unique perspective that
helps build a better product.</p>
<p>They have a 360 degree view of what is around them, and describes
accurately to the blind man what they see with little to no
ambiguity.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The law of small teams is useful because it is the most efficient way
of creating a function or a product, without any waste.</p>
<p><em>The main question that you need to ask to evaluate whether your
team is cross-functional, is “Do we have all the skills in the team to
deliver the product?” Having only one set of skills in a team will slow
down the cycle time, with the more skills outside the team, the slower
the product’s cycle time.</em></p>
<p>An agile team combine different and unique perspectives to form a
complete picture, with the least amount of waste.</p>

<h1 class="title">Happy workplaces are social</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

<p>Humans are inherently social beings. What makes us really happy,
apart from meaningful work, is social connections. The ability to
connect with peers and share thoughts and feelings in a safe
environment. A connection on a deeper level than merely sharing
work-related facts and figures. Being able to have a personality and
express it at work.  The more connected, the happier we are, and this
creates happy workplaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness collaborates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, we crave
being part of a group. The more people can socially connect, the happier
they are. Introverts might need less external stimuli than extroverts,
that does however not mean that they don’t need to feel connected.  Both
equally have a deep need for feeling connected to the people they spend
their time with and being in happy workplaces.</p>
<p>Spending on average a third of our day at work, it is essential that
you are able to satisfy this need for social connection without any
negative repercussions.</p>
<p>Sadly, however, most people are afraid to voice their perspectives at
work as it might unintentionally offend someone. Add to that a culture
where the only feedback received from your manager is when you did
something wrong, and you have a disconnected workplace where people
refrain from speaking to each other.</p>
<h2 id="now-were-talking">Now we’re talking!</h2>
<p>If you want happy workplaces, you need to get your employees talking
to each other. Once they are talking, they will be much more likely to
collaborate on projects and thus increase productivity. The more they
talk to each other, the better they will work together.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple ideas to help you get your team collaborating
to create happy workplaces.</p>
<h3 id="play-music">1. Play music</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to motivate people is by playing music. Not only
does it increase the energy, but it also creates a more social
atmosphere where it is easier to talk to each other without the fear of
someone overhearing your conversation.</p>
<p>Choose appropriate time intervals and play some music. For example,
play music for half an hour each morning while waiting for your computer
to boot, or Friday lunchtime to get into the weekend mood.</p>
<p>Ensure everyone’s taste in music is catered for by providing a
platform where people can request songs. Also, make sure to keep
changing the playlist to keep it interesting.</p>
<h3 id="give-kudos">2. Give Kudos</h3>
<p>Not a new concept, Kudos are a way to appreciate and recognize the
skills and effort of your co-workers.</p>
<p>In a culture where feedback from your manager is often associated
with negative feedback, this is a particularly powerful tool to build
trust while opening the communication channels.</p>
<p>You don’t need an app for saying thank you, and an unexpected
hand-written note is an awesome motivator, yet it might be a
nice-to-have for your team with many alternatives
available. For distributed teams or a workplace interested in analyzing
the results over time, an online version or app might be a good choice
to consider.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of resources providing ready-made templates for
each possible scenario you can think of if you lack creativity but lack
the idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But by far the best is simply a handwritten thank you on a sticky
note to welcome you at your desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s free, it’s easy, it’s awesome to receive.</p>
<h3 id="communication-style-profiling">3. Communication style
profiling</h3>
<p>Even though this is such a well-known and accepted method for
understanding your employees, mostly the results are kept secret in your
personal file away from any lurking eyes.</p>
<p>In the few environments where the results were shared with the team,
communication exponentially increased, which in turn resulted in better
team performance, as well as happy workplaces. Simply being reminded
that the colleague you think of as being dominant and bossy has a
different communication style than you, softens the judgment and makes
it easier to work together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever tool you choose is not that important, more important is
that you share the results with the team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember to view it as a process, not a one-off event and keep
reminding the team of the different communication styles and how to
react to it.</p>
<h3 id="team-challenges">4. Team challenges</h3>
<p>Many people are afraid to ask questions in front of their manager
that might make them look stupid. People also unintentionally compete
with each other trying to be seen as the ‘better’ performer in the team.
This is counter-productive.</p>
<p>To allow teams the opportunity to work together without the
interference or influence of the manager, give them a problem to solve
and then walk away. The only rules are that each team member needs to
contribute and that the manager will not be involved until the solution
is ready. Make it clear that each person in the team is
equally rewarded.</p>
<h3 id="silent-meetings">5. Silent meetings</h3>
<p>Communication does not mean that you have to speak. It is about each
team member is able to contribute, being understood and feeling valued
within the team. If you have one or two team members who tend to
dominate meetings, silent meetings are useful to involve the entire team
in the discussion or decision.</p>
<p>As the facilitator, pose a question to the team and explain that no
talking is allowed until they are instructed to. Each person then writes
as many ideas on sticky notes related to the problem that they can think
of without any influence from their peers.</p>
<p>Once all the ideas have been captured, post them on the wall and ask
the team to categorize them, again remaining silent.</p>
<p>As the last round, give each team member a certain amount of tokens
and ask them to vote for the highest priority items, yet again without
speaking.  Read more on this technique <a
href="http://gamestorming.com/core-games/dot-voting/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="paper-tables">6. Paper tables</h3>
<p>Communication is about expressing thoughts and feelings to someone
other than yourself. Few people are however able to articulate what is
going on inside their head, even fewer how they feel about
something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collaboration naturally happens when you feel that what you say are
understood and matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why not try drawing, not speaking, next time there is a
misunderstanding around a given topic. As the saying goes – a picture
speaks a thousand words.</p>
<p>Create collaboration spaces with paper tables and invite people to
make notes as they discuss a topic over coffee. A paper table is simply
a table covered with a large blank notepad or flip chart. As opposed to
relying on the traditional use of words, visualize the problem by
drawing or scribbling on the piece of paper for both to see.</p>
<p>To cater to the people who really struggle to withdraw, and to make
it an even more comfortable setting.  Add some old magazines. The
magazines can either be used as a reference or to cut out or point at
pictures best describing what you intend to communicate.</p>
<h3 id="eating-meetings">7. Eating meetings</h3>
<p>Next time you have a recurring and boring meeting such as a monthly
team meeting. Spice it up by changing the location to a place where the
team can eat together while the meeting is taking place.</p>
<p>Or simply use it as a way to create a culture that welcomes feedback.
Take your team to a coffee shop. Give positive feedback and recognize
team efforts in a relaxed setting.</p>
<p>This works better for less serious and smaller meetings focused on
information sharing and not decision-making or large teams.</p>
<p>Be careful that it doesn’t become standard or predictable however as
it’s the element of surprise that makes it enjoyable. Don’t only use
outdoor meetings for the positive feedback and in-house meetings for
negative feedback. Use it as a tool for both positive and negative
feedback.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Happy workplaces are social places where people connect with each
other.  To get your team to socialize, never force a social event on
them. Rather provide the tools to enable them, and reward the desired
behaviour as pointed out in this article.</p>
<p>How do you get your team talking?</p>

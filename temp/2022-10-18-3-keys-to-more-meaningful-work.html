    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">3 Keys to more meaningful work</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>
<p class="date">2016-07-03T09:15:07.009Z</p>
</header>
<p>We spend the majority of our day at work, yet I can literally count
the number of people that love what they do and feel it is meaningful on
my one hand. That is far less than 1% of the population and in my
opinion something to be concerned about.</p>
<p>The majority of people only work because “that’s what people do” or
because “it pays the bills”. Most people choose a career not based on
their passion, but rather on the promise of financial stability or
pleasing a parent, in many cases resulting in a lifelong commitment to
an unsatisfying job.</p>
<h1 id="stuck-in-the-rat-race">Stuck in the rat race</h1>
<p>Tired of being stuck in the rat race in an unsatisfying job, and even
more tired of witnessing friends and collueges spending the majority of
their day sacrificing time with their loved ones in a mission to survive
on a day-to-day-basis doing something they don’t even like, I embarked
on a journey to figure out how work can be more enjoyable and more
meaningful for the average person, and how companies can use this
information to create happy work environments, ultimately increasing
productivity, and thus profits.</p>
<p>I looked at both happy and unhappy people at work, and were
particularly perplexed at why thousands of educated people spend
thousands of dollars each year to do volunteer work in uncomfortable
conditions, forfeiting the luxuries that they love so much at home. It
doesn’t make sense, yet we keep doing it.</p>
<p>So I tried it myself, and in an attempt to understand what is so
satisfying about volunteering, worked for less than $500 per month
teaching English in Asia in a really uncomfortable and polluted 40
degrees environment, earning just enough money to scrape through the
month eating rice and fruit.</p>
<p>I discovered three key reasons why volunteering feels so meaningful
compared to “real” work, and how this can be used to make work more
meaningful, and ultimately more profitable for both the employer and the
employee:</p>
<h1 id="key-1-the-ability-to-solve-problems">Key #1 — The ability to
solve problems</h1>
<p>Deep down, we all love wicked problems. We love complaining about
them and sharing stories about how our problems are so much bigger than
our friend’s.</p>
<p>In a way, having problems make us feel valuable. Being presented with
an obstacle in our daily lives makes us feel as if we have a purpose,
meaning, that what we do matters. And, being the social beings that we
are, it gives us something to talk about in our otherwize boring
lives.</p>
<p>Being a problem solver however, I went to my employer, who has been
struggling with declined growth and already had to downsize quite
substantially, with a list of practical, easy and virtually free
solutions that can improve her cashflow immediately. Rather than being
delighted with the solutions presented to her, she was more delighted
with the opportunity to talk about the problems as she felt understood
when I accurately and concisely summarized her main problems. But she
didn’t do anything about it. It was as if she didn’t really want to do
anything about the problems and that simply feeling understood, was
enough.</p>
<p>That made me feel worthless however, as my work was unused waste, yet
she seemed satisfied with the relief of not having to carry the burdon
of all the problems on her own.</p>
<p>That got me thinking and I realized that this is true in most work
environments. Managers are often misunderstood and overburdoned with
problems that they feel they have to solve on their own, while employees
feel disempowered and under-utilized. So what can you do in your
workplace to allow employees to solve more problems?</p>
<p><strong><em>Reward the team for reporting problems and make it their
responsibility to solve. Help them create a business case for a suitable
solution and facilitate problem solving within the team, empowering and
supporting and allowing for innovation.</em></strong></p>
<h1 id="key-2-individual-challenges">Key #2 — Individual challenges</h1>
<p>In a team setting it is often hard to feel any sense of personal
achievement as successes are never as a result of only one person, and I
have found this to be very demotivating. It made me doubt my own value,
and whether what I did made any difference at all, especially when it is
so easy to replace the generic job titles, like cheap consumables.</p>
<p>But being the only change in a “problem child’s” world who showed no
progress over more than a year prior to my arrival and with two
different teachers, seeing the transformation within a few months can
conclusively be credited to my effort, and that makes me feel
valuable.</p>
<p>The once loud, disruptive 7 year old boy who refused to sit, speak
any English and keep quiet during class, has morphed into a model
student. Not only does he participate in class and keep quiet, he is in
charge of keeping the rest of the students quiet when I leave the
classroom, and consistently succeeds in my ever increasing
challenges.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that what I did made a difference, and seeing the
results of my hard work makes my work meaningful. In the corporate world
performance appraisals and career development plans are often focused on
the company’s goals and how the individual can fit into that picture.
Personal development goals are rarely taken into consideration, and
recongition is usually given on team level, not individual level. So how
can companies motivate employees more?</p>
<p><strong><em>Introduce individual challenges which are directly
aligned with the individual’s needs for personal or technical
growth.</em></strong></p>
<p>When you include personal goals in career development plans, it not
only grows the individual’s talent, and with that the asset in
intellectual property, but will breed a culture of responsibility and
trust, where people take ownership of their own lives.</p>
<h1 id="key-3-make-it-real">Key #3 — Make it real</h1>
<p>Teaching in Thailand for just enough money to get through the month
is definitely not a sutainable or sensible career choice, and the only
reason why I did it, was because I felt that I made a difference in real
lives. It felt meaningful.</p>
<p>I could see the difference that I made in people’s lives, and that’s
real. So much more real and valuable than I’ve ever felt sitting in a
comfortable office behind a computer earning $15 000 per month.
(Although I must be honest, at this stage, that sounds enticing).</p>
<p>When I see how my students’ grades at school improve, or how they got
a promotion as a result of their improved English skills, or simply just
having a conversation where a few months ago they were not able to
converse at all, it feels real.</p>
<p>In a corporate environment the teams doing the work are often removed
from the customers, and they don’t see how what they do matters or is
used. How can corporates use this knowledge?</p>
<p><strong><em>Ingredient # 3 for happy workplaces is to connect the
team with the implementation of their work in a real environment, and
giving them an opportunity to obtain direct feedback.</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to do this is to introduce “shadow sessions”, where the
employee spends a day observing either the real users of the product or
service, or someone from a different business unit such as marketing or
customer care.</p>
<p>This will help team members gain a better understanding of how their
work is being used and why specific solutions are chosen. It will
improve cross-departmental communication as well as cross-skill
employees, allowing them to help out in other departments during peak
times, and utlimately, that means being more agile, creating
cross-functional teams.</p>
<p>Happy workplaces are workplaces where people contribute to something
bigger than themselves. It is places where what each person does is
valuable and valued. It is places where they can grow.</p>
<p>Creating happy workplaces don’t require any financial investment or a
lot of effort. It merely means that you as manager or leader needs to
listen to your team, empower them to solve problems and allow them to
fail.</p>
<p>Meaningful work is work where you can see the impact of what you are
doing, and meaningful work is one of the most satisfying things any
person can do.</p>

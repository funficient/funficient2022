    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>Probably the biggest barrier to moving towards <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/09/18/autonomous-teams/">autonomous</a>,
self-organizing teams is the fear of chaos. A valid fear indeed. Without
a dedicated authority figure, it can be frustrating to distribute
responsibilities and coordinate projects. But it doesn’t have to be
frustrating or chaotic to transition to <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-09-01-reinventing-organizations/">‘teal’</a>.
This post looks at how organizations operating from a mainly teal
paradigm might coordinate projects, and how to get from ‘orange’ to
‘teal’, without the chaos. In essence, we consider what does teal
project management look like?</p>
<p>This is the third in a series of posts looking at the characteristics
of teal workplaces.  The first looked at a possible <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">organizational
structure</a>, and the second at the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/25/teal-leadership/">leadership
style</a> within a predominantly teal organization.  But first, let’s
look at the intent of project management, or coordination.</p>
<h2 id="the-intent-of-coordination">The intent of coordination</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of coordination – whether operating from an
orange or teal paradigm – is to ensure all the different knowledge areas
of project management are included in any project.</p>
<p>Another key purpose is managing expectations and alignment. I’ve
never worked with a customer that is unhappy when you’re transparent,
honest, responsible, and manage expectations.  That, in my opinion, is
the primary role of project management.</p>
<p>With this intent in mind, let’s delve into the specific
characteristics of each paradigm. We’ll first look at what the core
characteristics are, and then a possible roadmap from ‘orange’ to
‘teal’.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-orange-project-coordination">Characteristics
of ‘orange’ Project coordination</h2>
<p>Typically, an organization operating from an orange paradigm
coordinates projects through fixed meetings at every level. This often
leads to meeting overload. Typically there is little time for <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/07/most-productive-thing/">productive</a>
work or <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/06/15/answer-life-universe-everything/">communicating</a>
to the team what was said in the meeting, making it obsolete.</p>
<p>Traditional project management consists of several knowledge areas.
Typically, an ‘orange’ project manager relies heavily on artefacts for
each knowledge area. They often spend more time documenting evidence
than responding to the challenges and changes <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/10/03/work-environment-conducive/">within
the environment</a>.</p>
<h3 id="scope-and-time">Scope and time</h3>
<p>There is typically a project manager for each project. They are
responsible for producing detailed schedules and regular status reports
to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/10/28/first-time-manager/">manage
time</a> and scope.</p>
<p>In larger organizations, there are also program managers to perform a
similar function on a higher level. The project or program manager is
the primary decision-maker when it comes to changes in priorities,
scope, or due dates.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Information is mostly shared on a need-to-know basis. Most of the
information is confidential. There are clearly defined communication
channels, often formalized with regular status reports and meetings.</p>
<p>The focus is often on gathering evidence rather than delivering a
project. Typically, a lot of time is spent on administrative tasks.</p>
<h3 id="company-objectives">Company objectives</h3>
<p>Typically the executive team might come together once or twice a year
to decide on the next year’s objectives. This is usually more strategic
in nature, looking at possibly expanding market share or reducing
overhead in certain areas. The outcomes are communicated to the rest of
the organization with little to no input from them.</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-incentives">Measures and incentives</h3>
<p>Objectives are measured predominantly in absolute and granular
numbers.  Individuals are rewarded for performance based on these
numbers.</p>
<p>As this is such an important and key success factor, I’ll cover <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/11/20/measure-value/">measurements</a>
and incentives in a separate, future post.  The key, however, is that
the primary measure of success is profit and efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="managing-risks">Managing risks</h3>
<p>Many larger organizations have dedicated risk departments.  They are
responsible for thinking about the worst possible scenarios and
mitigating any risks proactively. This often slows down projects and can
be in conflict with operational teams.</p>
<p>In smaller teams, the project manager is responsible for identifying
and managing risks. In reality, few project managers proactively manage
risks and usually address issues as and when they arise reactively.</p>
<h3 id="cost-quality-and-other-knowledge-areas">Cost, Quality and other
knowledge areas</h3>
<p>Not intended to be a complete mapping and analysis of all the
different project management knowledge areas, in summary, each knowledge
area has a dedicated decision-maker who produces extensive policies and
procedures for their area of expertise.</p>
<p>This often results in rather fragmented and unconnected procedures
that create confusion and conflict.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-teal-coordination">Characteristics of ‘teal’
coordination</h2>
<p>A predominantly ‘teal’ organization, using <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">teal
project management principles, on the other hand, manages in a
content-fre</a>e manner. Rather than <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/10/16/trust-and-control/">control</a>
the project details, they design and facilitate processes. The role of
project management thus becomes that of a designer and facilitator
rather than a planner and controller.</p>
<p>Teal project management is radically simplified with no dedicated
project manager role as such. Rather, the project management
<em>responsibilities</em> are distributed between the team.</p>
<p>Below are the key characteristics or practices of what ‘teal’ project
coordination might look like.</p>
<h3 id="open-space-structure">Open-space structure</h3>
<p>Projects can be initiated by anyone in an open-space. A <a
href="https://www.facilitator.school/blog/open-space-technology">facilitator
explains what an open-space is</a>. Thereafter participants are invited
to add any topic of their choice in the dedicated empty spaces provided
on a first-come-first-serve basis. These topics are pitched in a
marketplace format. Participants can freely choose which topics most
interest them and join a discussion they feel they can either contribute
to or gain something from.</p>
<p>When the time-box for a topic discussion is over, everyone moves on
to the next topic of their choice. At the end of each session or the end
of the day, the topics are briefly reflected upon. People have the
opportunity to opt into taking a topic further outside the open-space,
with the open-space’s main purpose being that of coordination and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/10/27/transparent-leader/">transparency</a>.</p>
<p>This means that in the scope of teal project management only projects
people believe in will be taken forward, drastically reducing waste. It
also means that everyone is empowered to initiate a project, provided
they can get adequate support.</p>

alt="Example of an open-space structure" /></a></p>
<p>Image obtained from https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/11234467255</p>
<h3 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h3>
<p>Where in an ‘orange’ organization or team there are fixed departments
and roles defined, in a ‘teal’ organization these knowledge areas are
handled as perspectives. A perspective can be held by one person within
a cross-functional team, for example, a knowledge area specialist. Or it
can be included using parallel thinking, where everyone in the team
spends time focusing on one perspective before moving on to the
next.</p>
<p>When a group decides to move a topic discussed in an open-space
forward, all the required perspectives needs to be represented. These
perspectives, serving as a shared vocabulary, will differ depending on
the industry. In a typical software development team, for example, the
three key perspectives needed are design (or product), engineering, and
data. Within manufacturing, data might be replaced by operations or
logistics. In retail, these roles might include sales and inventory
management.</p>
<p>Apart from these key perspectives, there are typically also general
perspectives that might be adopted by anyone. For example, you might
want to add a risk perspective, a quality perspective, a financial
perspective, or a marketing perspective.</p>
<p>Finally, an advisor role completes the cross-functional team. The
advisor, or advisors, other than the rest of the team, is not part of
the project team. They serve as objective outsiders to either provide
specialist information or resolve conflict when needed.</p>
<p>Coordination requires that the important perspectives are clearly
defined. Each project aims to add all these perspectives, either with
dedicated people or in an ensemble style where each person adds to a
specific area for a more complete view.</p>
<h3 id="team-agreement">Team agreement</h3>
<p>Once a team represents all the different perspectives required, a
team agreement is defined. The primary purpose of the team agreement is
to agree on responsibilities, scope, boundaries, communication
preferences and needs.</p>
<p>As a predominantly teal organization typically communicates through
fluid ad-hoc discussions, it’s important to explicitly agree on
expectations at the onset of the project. What channel do you use to
communicate? Do you want people to be available at specific times? Do
you expect an answer or response within a specific time frame if async
is preferred? How do you discern between important and normal work items
in a chat? What do you document and where?</p>
<p>The team agrees on this upfront, however, if something is overlooked,
a spot-contract can be agreed upon at any time during the project. It’s
important to note that nothing is written in stone. A team agreement
remains valid only because it works for everyone involved. Whenever
something doesn’t work anymore, it is re-contracted.</p>
<h3 id="accountability">Accountability</h3>
<p>Finally, once a team and the agreement are complete, work officially
starts. Now is the time to reflect on accountability and how to show
progress if it hasn’t been covered in the preceding forums. <em>How will
you know</em> your project is successful? What are the key metrics? How
and when will it be measured?</p>
<p>What do you do when a project doesn’t give the desired results? When
do you pull the plug? Or when do you pivot? A ‘teal’ organization
inherently requires responsible people for it to work and be profitable.
<a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/09/02/the-accountability-factor/">Accountability
is a key success factor</a> for companies to benefit from autonomy and
prevent people from working on projects that are fun for them but don’t
directly contribute to the success of the business.</p>
<p>If you want responsible people, give them responsibility. Also,
define the consequences of failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With great <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/02/15/responsibility/">power
comes great responsibility.”</a> — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from ‘orange’ to
‘teal’</h2>
<p>Coordination is probably the hardest area to transition as it
directly impacts operations and with that the cash flow of the company.
It’s thus advised to start with practising and refining the process and
practices in a risk-free environment.</p>
<h3 id="practice-on-an-internal-project">1. Practice on an internal
project</h3>
<p>Allocate a few hours per week dedicated to internal improvement
projects that do not impact a customer. For optimum results make it
voluntary as it is better to have a handful of supporters than a room
full of people who don’t want to be there.</p>
<p>If it works more people will inevitably join, growing organically.
Either or, you have nothing to lose and might gain a few improvements by

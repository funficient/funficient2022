<h2 id="self-awareness-and-growth-in-the-workplace">Self-awareness and
growth in the workplace</h2>
<p>Have you ever watched Will &amp; Grace, a sitcom with a gay guy and
his best friend Grace, whom was in love with him? They’re soul mates not
ever meant to be together. They are two parts of the same coin in
separate bodies, but with such different desires and needs in life that
they are incompatible. She wants to get married and have kids and kiss
her husband under the mistletoe. He, on the other hand, can’t be
intimate with women.</p>
<p>But they have more in common than what they disagree on, and they
continue living together as best friends, making their odd relationship
work somehow.</p>
<p>It’s a story I love for the total acceptance there is between these
two very different people. The brutal honesty that sometimes hurts. The
connection and commitment stronger than anything or anyone else in their
lives.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about relationships, this is a series I can
recommend.</p>
<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The elephant in the room</h2>
<p>However, I stopped watching at a stage because Grace got pregnant
while continuing to act during her pregnancy. Initially, she just gained
a few pounds and someone made a funny comment about it. Then, however,
the bump started to show and I anxiously waited for someone to say
something. But rather than say anything, they tried to hide it. Covering
her tummy with a cushion and making her sit as much as possible so that
the growing child inside her remains invisible to the audience.</p>
<p>Later in her pregnancy, it wasn’t possible anymore to hide it and I
was sure they are going to weave this into the story somehow. But each
episode came and went without mention of a pregnancy or a baby.</p>
<p>Finally, she gave birth and was written out of the story for a few
episodes before she returned. Still, nothing was said, as if it never
happened. Not a peep from anyone.</p>
<p>I stopped watching. It bothered me for months in the background of my
mind. Not that I usually ponder sitcoms I watch, especially not comic
relief as Will &amp; Grace is intended to be. But it really, really,
really bothered me that nothing was mentioned for something so
obvious.</p>
<h2
id="why-does-it-bother-me-that-no-one-talks-about-the-elephant-in-the-room">Why
does it bother me that no-one talks about the elephant in the room?</h2>
<p>As a thinker, constantly doing retrospect of anything that causes me
emotional discomfort, I decided to figure out why this bothered me so
much. I realized that it reminds me of work. Where so many elephants are
in the room but no-one ever mentions it, hoping that if it’s not called
on it’s name that it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>But it does.</p>
<p>Everyone knows it. Everyone can see it. Everyone experiences it. Yet,
no-one is willing to talk about it. Or even admit it exists.</p>
<p>Except me that is. I don’t like secrets much. It always hurts more
than hearing the truth when someone keeps a secret. It also denies
restoring harmony in a relationship. You wouldn’t let your best friend
or partner walk out of the house with an odd pair of shoes, so why
should you not want to point out when your co-workers are behaving in a
dysfunctional way?</p>
<p>When the elephant is allowed for long enough without talking about
it, it becomes part of the toxic culture which destroys relationships
and with that trust.</p>
<p>When you do talk about the elephant in the room it might be
uncomfortable and might even hurt, but also it gives you an opportunity
to resolve the disharmony that exists. And it only hurts when your ego
is inflated because without an ego it is merely what it is — an elephant
in the room that doesn’t belong there. It’s not good or bad, it’s just
not advisable to have an elephant in the room if you want to have a
trusting, high performance team. It’s simply functional to find ways to
reduce the size of the elephant or get rid of it totally. It’s for the
better of the entire organization.</p>
<p>By refusing to acknowledge the elephant it just gets bigger. Ignoring
it doesn’t make it disappear magically.</p>
<h1 id="the-topic-of-trust">The topic of trust</h1>
<p>In a recent post called <strong>“Dear Agile, I’m Tired of
Pretending”</strong> by <a
href="https://medium.com/u/11cac4e04f40?source=post_page-----df509f3278af--------------------------------">Charles
Lambdin</a> he succinctly summarizes this phenomenon in one
sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ Agile actually tends to mask the core problem, which is a systemic,
bidirectional lack of vertical trust.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t necessarily agree that agile masks the core problem, as agile
rather reveals the problem than mask it. I also don’t think agile as
such can be blamed for trust issues but rather the culture, the agile
implementation and most of all the leadership within the organization.
And maybe the amount of certified Scrum Masters out there who have no
idea of what agility is really about as it’s not possible to teach that
in 2 days.</p>
<p>But I do agree that the core problem in organizations where agile is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> working well is a lack of trust.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-missing-trust">The impact of missing trust</h2>
<p>When you’re not willing to hear the people on the floor as a leader,
you break down trust. When you feel you’re unable to speak to a leader
or have input into decisions as an employee, you tend to speak about it
with your co-workers at the water coolers in a negative way.</p>
<p>Because everyone wants to be heard. Even if it means that it needs to
be talked about secretly behind the manager’s back.</p>
<p>When people can’t be vulnerable and speak truthfully, there can be no
trust. Without trust, no matter how well your intentions, your agile
transformation will only be as effective as the amount of effort you can
invest in convincing people to do what you want them to do. Eventually,
you’ll get tired of always having to beg an plead and fight though. It’s
not a sustainable approach to change.</p>
<h2 id="do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do">Do as I say, not as I do</h2>
<p>Words mean very little when you are a leader. It’s the actions that
define who you are in the eyes of your team. People don’t do as you
<em>say</em>, they do as you <em>do</em>. Most leaders however except
their teams to behave as they say they want them to behave. Their
actions however contradict this and it causes confusion. Ultimately,
however, it’s the actions that will trump in the fight for behavior
change.</p>
<p>From a young age the way we learn is by observing and copying. First
we copy our family, then we copy our peers and teachers. We learn from
each other what is acceptable behavior and what not.</p>
<p>In the business world, being successful usually means being in the
good books of your CEO or direct manager. That means you have to behave
in a way that he or she deems ‘good behavior’. This happens so automatic
that most people don’t even realize they are doing it. They just know
that it gets them the approval they want and continue doing so, forming
it as a habit, without questioning whether it is a good or bad habit for
the situation.</p>
<h1 id="talking-truthfully">Talking truthfully</h1>
<p>Being honest, however, is not easy for most people. The bigger your
ego the harder it is to hear the truth.</p>
<p>The truth however doesn’t have to hurt. It merely requires you to
step back and view it from an objective, curious objective. Rather than
immediately respond and react by rejecting the person who told you a
truth you would rather not hear, look at it curiously.</p>
<p><em>Is it really true?</em></p>
<p><em>Can you find proof of how it is true and how it is
false?</em></p>
<p><em>How does your role models behave given the same
situation?</em></p>
<p><em>What is the impact when you do the opposite?</em></p>
<p>Rather than seeing it as an attack on you as a person, see it as an
opportunity to experiment. See it as a chance to gain self-awareness.
Use it to grow.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-elephant-useful"><strong>Is the elephant
useful?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether it is true or not doesn’t matter as much as acknowledging the
elephant and analysing its validity and usefulness. Just because there’s
an elephant doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. Grace having a baby wasn’t
bad as such, it was just unspoken of. There was no explanation
given.</p>
<p>When Wikipedia originally became popular it received a lot of
criticism of not being accurate. Academics discarded it, not accepting
it as a reputable source of information and when people used it as
reference, the were corrected.</p>
<p>Whether it was true or not, it was an accurate reflection of people’s
beliefs around certain topics. Wikipedia in fact gave us the opportunity
to become aware of how wrong we were on certain subjects and now it is
deemed a much more reputable source of information than what it was
years ago.</p>
<p>But it was the elephant in the room that was in everyone’s head only
until there was a platform where it could be validated and interpreted
by other people, with the result making it more accurate.</p>
<p>When Twitter recently used AI to learn what people know, they
switched it off because within the first few hours the main learning was
that the <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist">chatbot
was a racist asshole</a>.</p>
<p>Does it make the information wrong or bad? Absolutely not. It’s a
true reflection of the mindset of many people tweeting and what is in
the news. It is an inconvenient truth, something we would rather not
have, but it is true nevertheless.</p>
<p>It does, however, also give us the opportunity to become aware of
this undesirable topics that we talk about and we can actively do
something about it. We can stop tweeting about the bad things and focus
on the more positive options. We can stop following the news channels
and people broadcasting these messages and find channels who broadcasts
something more useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elephant in the room is not the bad guy. It’s just that. It’s an
elephant in the room.</p>
<p>It’s something that needs to be spoken about.</p>
<p>So talk about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By talking about the elephant you give an opportunity to build trust
and more functional habits within an organization. You also give an
opportunity to improve performance and productivity. And who doesn’t
want that?</p>

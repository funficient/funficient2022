    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>According to <a
href="https://b2b-assets.glassdoor.com/the-true-cost-of-a-bad-hire.pdf">research</a>
“<em>…strong onboarding processes increase new hire retention by 82% and
improve productivity by 70%.</em>”  In practice, however, 88% of new
hires don’t deem their onboarding process sufficient or a good
experience. As part of the teal series, this post focuses on what teal
onboarding might look like.</p>
<p>First, I’ll outline the typical ‘orange’ characteristics of
onboarding, then what a more ‘teal’ approach might look like, and
finally, a rough roadmap to transition from ‘orange’ to ‘teal’.</p>
<h2 id="orange-onboarding">Orange onboarding</h2>
<p>In a more traditional ‘orange’ organization <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/09/28/start-onboarding-right/">onboarding</a>
is mostly administration-heavy in an all-at-once approach. According to
<a
href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/onboarding-statistics/">Zippia</a>,
each new hire completes an average of 41 administrative tasks as part of
onboarding.</p>
<p>The key characteristics of typical ‘orange’ onboarding include:</p>
<h3 id="administrative-focus">1. Administrative focus</h3>
<p>A new employee typically receives a handbook with all the policies
and procedures to go through before they start productive work.  They
are also typically invited to attend several onboarding training
sessions dependent on their role.</p>
<p>The focus of onboarding is administrative, providing all the
procedural resources up-front. Onboarding is a necessary stepping stone
that must be completed before any <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/09/14/productive-work-environment/">productive
work</a> can start.</p>
<h3 id="owned-by-human-resources">2. Owned by Human Resources</h3>
<p>The policies and procedures are typically owned by the Human
Resources department. Originally designed to take the burden off having
to repeat the same information to every new hire, which can become
overwhelming at high growth times or when turnover is high, it serves as
a repository of the written down rules of the organization.</p>
<p>The handbook ensures no important information is forgotten.  It
provides each new employee with a complete reference regarding the
general procedures like applying for leave or submitting time sheets. 
It is an important asset that remains important in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">‘teal’
organizations</a>.</p>
<h3 id="focused-on-specific-roles">3. Focused on specific roles</h3>
<p>Additional to the more general procedures like applying for leave,
onboarding typically focuses on role-specific requirements and needs. A
marketing hire will, for example, only have access to marketing
resources. A new developer is shown the technical resources to
familiarize themselves with the technology. A new accountant is
introduced to the accounting software and procedures.</p>
<p>There is little to no overlap between different roles or departments
other than the general support processes.</p>
<h2 id="teal-onboarding">Teal onboarding</h2>
<p>An organization operating from a mainly teal paradigm primarily focus
on culture. Typically, onboarding aims to immerse the new hire into the
culture.  Onboarding also aims to give a more complete understanding of
the entire organization and value chain.</p>
<p>Below are the key characteristics and differences between ‘orange’
and ‘teal’ onboarding.  Although each organization might uniquely handle
onboarding, these are the more general trends of how the most successful
companies approach onboarding.</p>
<h3 id="just-in-time-or-on-demand-information">1. Just-in-time or
on-demand information</h3>
<p>One of the key differences between ‘orange’ onboarding and onboarding
within a more ‘teal’ way of working is that information is rolled out
over time rather than up-front.  People receive information as they need
it, not before.</p>
<p>For example, they will only ask about or look up a leave procedure
when they need to apply for leave. This approach reduces cognitive
overload and with that, the risk of mistakes early on.</p>
<p>Rather than give a new hire a few days or week to go through all the
written down procedures on their own, they are immersed in the
organizational activities in a guided tour-like manner.  Like a buffet
table filled with various dishes, onboarding aims to show the new hire
all the different aspects and functions.  They can ask questions as they
need the information or as uncertainty arises.</p>
<h3 id="rotational-programs">2. Rotational programs</h3>
<p>As wholeness is such a big focus on ‘teal’ organizations, new hires
are included and immersed in all the different functions to gain a
complete understanding of the entire business. This supports the systems
thinking approach and understanding of the impact of any change or
project.  It also allows new hires to design a personal progression
path. When, in future, they want more exposure to a specific function
they can volunteer to a project in this capacity.</p>
<p>Another important consequence of rotation is that it supports
cross-functional team formation. When a new project or task starts, they
know what skills and resources are available and where to get them.</p>
<p>A key benefit that emerges from rotation is that the new hire is
introduced to the shared vocabulary specific to the organization. One of
the most confusing parts of working in a large ‘orange’ organization is
the use of acronyms and different people having different understandings
of the same words used based on their experience. In a ‘teal’
organization, this shared vocabulary can intentionally be introduced
with the rotational program in a show-don’t-tell way as they move
through each function.</p>
<h3 id="buddies-and-mentors">3. Buddies and mentors</h3>
<p>As culture is so important in a ‘teal’ organization a buddy or <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/10/15/key-elements-of-mentoring/">mentor</a>
is usually assigned to each new hire. This buddy or mentor is there to
answer any questions the new hire might have while they are getting
acquainted with the new ways of working.</p>
<p>The buddy can also serve as an accountability partner or peer coach.
Once onboarding is complete the relationship might continue, or a new
mentor or buddy can be selected.</p>
<p>The goal of these one-to-one relationships is to learn from each
other and actively get to know each team member’s strengths and
weaknesses to better support each other.  It also aims to increase
resilience.  In a peer-coaching culture, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/people-development-network/">people’s
development</a> is ingrained within the culture.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>As onboarding is dealing with someone new to the organization with no
prior expectations, changing the process is relatively easy.  Below is a
possible roadmap to transition to a more <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/06/09/teal-hiring/">teal
way to onboard new hires</a>.</p>
<h3 id="identify-a-suitable-buddy-or-mentor">1. Identify a suitable
buddy or mentor</h3>
<p>The first and most important thing to focus on is to identify a
suitable buddy or mentor who will be available to answer questions. 
This would typically be someone in the same function or a complementary
function who can answer most questions the new hire might have on a
practical level.</p>
<h3 id="invite-changes-and-additions-to-the-procedures">2. Invite
changes and additions to the procedures</h3>
<p>There’s an old saying <em>“New brooms sweep clean.”</em>   New people
see the reality of things as they are without the filters and
conditioning of the people who are used to things.  This makes the
newest person in the team the most valuable asset to identify possible
gaps and areas of confusion.</p>
<p>Invite new hires to suggest changes and additions to the procedures
to improve the quality and maintain the accuracy and usefulness of the
company handbook.</p>
<h3 id="plan-for-rotation">3. Plan for rotation</h3>
<p>Finally, plan for rotation.  This is possibly the most challenging
part as it requires coordination between different functions and
balancing workload.</p>
<p>The goal of the rotation is to give everyone hands-on experience
within each part of the system.  Identify low-risk, easy tasks that will
give someone a good idea of what type of work gets done and how it gets
done in each function.  These tasks will typically not require
specialized skills.</p>
<p>The focus is merely to immerse new people into all areas so that they
know what gets done where.  A key outcome is to have a better
understanding of the impact of any project in the organization.  They
will also know who to ask for help when needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Teal organizations place less emphasis on procedures and more
emphasis on relationships and the culture when onboarding a new
hire.</p>
<p>The goal is to give them the support they need, make them feel
welcome, and create space for them to ask for what they need,
understanding that each person might need something different to become
proficient in their role.</p>
<p>Are you ready to transition to a more teal way of working?</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">Do you live your passion?</h1>

<p><em>A rough guide to a more meaningful work life.</em></p>
<p>They say that when you find your passion, you will never work another
day in your life again. Yet most people see their career merely as a
means to an end. Something that will pay the bills. Something to get
through with grinding teeth until Friday, when they can start living. If
you are one of those people that dread Monday’s and sick of it, this
article is for you. It’s about finding your passion and enabling you to
take steps to lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-does-passion-look-like-anyway">So what does passion look
like anyway?</h2>
<p>I recently met a teacher who told me an inspiring story about being
asked to tutor a foreign student who struggled at school as he could
neither speak the native language of the country he was living in, nor
English as the secondary language at the school. As the student didn’t
have a lot of money and couldn’t afford extra classes, the teacher
approached the child offering extra classes to him on one condition. He
had to complete two terms without paying anything to prove that he
really wanted to learn, as if he payed for the lessons, he might only
attend class because he had to, not because he was intrinsically
motivated to attend.</p>
<p>The story ended happily with the student improving his grades to such
an extent that he was accepted into the medical school of his choice in
persuit of becoming a doctor, something that would have been impossible
without the extra tutoring he received. One passionate teacher managed
to make a boy’s dream come true, while receiving the biggest gift anyone
could give him in return.</p>
<p>He didn’t worry about being compensated for the extra hours or
whether it was part of his job description, and he never considered not
taking him under his wing when asked to work for free. When he told me
the story years after it happened, his eyes lit up and his entire world
stopped in a moment of sweet memory as he recollected the
experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>That is passion. Sweet, pure satisfaction. A sense of
achievement. Bliss.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And no monetary bonus could give the same continuous satisfaction to
this teacher, even years afterwards, as that one student’s success
story. And that is exactly why it is so important for you to find your
passion.</p>
<h2 id="happiness-is-a-feeling-not-a-thing"><em>Happiness is a feeling,
not a thing</em></h2>
<p>No amount of earthly possessions will ever make you happy for longer
than maybe a few weeks if you’re really lucky. The more you buy, the
more you want. Having things are not a good source of happiness, and not
very sustainable, unless you are Warren Buffet or Bill Gates.</p>
<p>If you really want to be happy, don’t ask yourself what you want
next, rather ask yourself how you can be of service. It is in the giving
that you will find your happiness, not the receiving. But what you
receive in return is worth far more than what money can ever buy.</p>
<p>Not everyone is however as lucky as this teacher who knew from a
young age that he wanted to be a teacher. I, for one, have spent close
to 40 years trying to figure out what my passion is, as nothing felt
satisfying for long. Like in the movie “Chocolat”, I couldn’t stop
searching for the place that felt like home. It was as if an internal
teacher was constantly making life just a little more uncomfortable than
what I could handle to stop me from settling and falling into
complacency, even though I really wanted to. Everytime I changed jobs
would think I want to stay here forever, and everytime the same
discomfort returned after I learnt what was needed to be learnt.</p>
<p>Until finally I found, or rather acknowledged, my passion.</p>
<p><em>Little did I realize was that I wasn’t searching for the perfect
job, I was searching for what makes me happy in a job.</em></p>
<p>Now it doesn’t matter where I am as everywhere feels like home. There
is a peacefulness and comfort that comes from knowing what you’re meant
to be doing and finally I can really stay forever. I know exactly what I
want making it easy to recognize when it does come over my path.
Previously I was searching for something, but not sure what. Now I know
what I’m looking for. Clarity.</p>
<h1 id="not-so-simple-questions-in-pursuit-of-happiness">3 Not-So-Simple
Questions in Pursuit of Happiness</h1>
<p>If you are looking for the same kind of peacefulness, or simply just
want to find a career that is more aligned with what makes you happy,
ask yourself these three questions.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-people-thank-you-for">1. What do people thank you
for?</h2>
<p>Generally what you are good at comes so naturally to you that you
don’t even notice it. You take it for granted because it is so easy. But
it is as easily overlooked and an external viewpoint will help you
become more aware of your natural talent.</p>
<p>Start noticing what people thank you for — both your collueges and
your friends. Often your friends will see your strengths far easier than
you or your collueges, and your passion will show everywhere, not only
at work. Alternatively, ask for refferals after a project to hear what
people felt you contributed most.</p>
<p>Be open to the responses as it will often not be what you expected. I
was surprised to find out that people thank me most for clarifying
information. I was expecting something more concrete, or at least
something you can find on a skills matrix, like analyzing data or
process design. Clarifying information seemed so vague, but then became
so blatantly obvious that I don’t know how I could have missed it.</p>
<p>Whether it is a problem, a complex system interaction, or a process,
I have the ability to simplify it to such an extent that everyone
understands within minutes what previously took hours of unnecessary
meetings, still resulting in expensive misunderstandings.</p>
<p>I don’t see it as work, I just simply love visualising information
and talking to the right people to understand the issues. No-one taught
me how to do it, and most of my jobs never required me to do it, yet it
is something that I just naturally do because I love it.</p>
<h2 id="what-cant-you-stop-doing">2. What can’t you stop doing?</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you are being paid or not, what can’t you stop
doing? What do you find yourself doing for free? What lights you up and
makes you feel alive when you do it?</p>
<p>Start noticing what you do that you are not paid for, whether inside
or outside work hours. If you can’t stop writing, maybe you should write
a book. If you can’t stop listening to people’s problems and giving them
advice, maybe you should look into attending a coaching course. If you
can’t stop singing, maybe you should join a band.</p>
<p>Whether I’m being paid or not, I simply can’t stop finding easier
ways to do things. I constantly find myself designing solutions to
problems that doesn’t involve me at all. When I’m irritated with the
train system, I design a system or process to make it easier to connect
the trains and buy tickets. When I look at a website, I can’t help but
start writing down recommendations on how to improve the user
experience.</p>
<p>I simply can’t stop finding solutions to everyday problems. Whether
I’m paid or not, I volunteer my services for the simple satisfaction
that it brings me in doing it. Even if people paid me not to do it would
I be able to stop.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-biggest-frustration">3. What is your biggest
frustration?</h2>
<p>Your biggest frustration is where your talent lies. Frustration is
like an inner alarm going off screaming “Opportunity!” but because you
are so unaware, you simply try to ignore it, like an annoying mosquito
that keeps you awake at night.</p>
<p>Notice where you get most frustrated and start asking yourself how
you can alleviate the frustration. If you keep noticing bad body
posture, maybe you should become a physiotherapist, if you keep noticing
how bad companies represent themselves, maybe you should go into
marketing.</p>
<p>My biggest frustration is inefficiency. I didn’t realize that I’m the
only one getting frustrated with this until I started asking people
around me, who only started noticing it after I pointed it out.</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense if I’m all about making things easier and more
efficient, but it sure didn’t feel like it while I was so annoyed and
not knowing what my passion in life really is.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>A select few people are lucky enough to be born knowing what they
want to be when they grow up. However a large percentage of the
population doesn’t have a clue what their passion is, mostly ending up
in a frustrating and unfulfilling career that their parents or society
probably wanted them to be in rather than it being their choice.</p>
<p>In order to find your passion and enable you to make career choices
more aligned with your personal vision, start noticing what people thank
you for, what you can’t stop doing and what frustrates you most.</p>

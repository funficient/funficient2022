    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The good, the bad and the
ugly</h2>
<p>Years ago I read a book on what make things go viral. I can’t
remember the details, but I do remember that one factor was what the
author called bragging rights. I call it the
<em>keeping-up-with-the-Jones’-syndrome</em>. People tend to jump on a
bandwagon before finding out where it is going, just because everyone
else is doing it. This post aims to highlight the good, the bad, and the
ugly of the Ethereum block chain to help you look past the buzz and
decide whether to put that web app on the block chain or not.</p>
<p><em>When a friend asked my opinion to put a document collection and
processing application intended for the general public in support of the
local police service on the block chain or not, my immediate response
was a clear and confident <strong>no</strong>. Here’s why.</em></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I am no specialist on any of the block chain
technologies and know just enough to ask the right questions and this is
my objective opinion based on my personal research from an end-user
perspective.</em></p>
<p>Ethereum is fast becoming one of the most popular block chains
available. There is a lot of good and exciting things happening in the
Ethereum space, but first things first.</p>
<h1 id="a-dummies-guide-to-block-chains-and-ethereum">A dummies guide to
block chains and Ethereum</h1>
<p>For those not familiar with block chains, the main promise that the
block chain brings include decentralization, transparency and privacy
for financial (for a lack of a better term) transactions.</p>
<p>Ethereum took the block chain technology with all these benefits to
the next level by creating an entire ecosystem — including financial
transactions but so much more — based on the same principles. It can
thus rather be seen as a block chain technology platform than a crypto
currency network like the BitCoin block chain. Anything can be put on
the block chain, and that’s part of the vision of Ethereum — to create
the next web (or web3).</p>
<p><em>Decentralization</em> refers to the concept of distributed
decision making and what caused the initial buzz as it was directly
opposing the centralized systems of banks and financial institutions. In
other words, and in rather very simplified layman’s terms, there is not
one decider responsible for decisions affecting the masses and thus no
single point of control. Without a single point of control the
boundaries and red tape instituted by governments and financial
institutions that discriminate against people considered not part of
their team are broken. It makes it possible for anyone, anywhere in the
world — as long as they have internet and a device — to transact with
anyone else, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Just take a minute to consider the impact of that because it’s really
big.</p>
<p><em>It basically means all borders between countries are removed to
create a single world where all people are equal in terms of value
exchange for services and goods.</em></p>
<p>It also means no more corruption and no fraud with money laundering
something of the past. In an ideal world that is. Each block chain
transaction is transparent and permanent meaning anyone — including you
— can view all transactions that has occurred — from people you know and
people you have never met.</p>
<p>One example of what’s called a block chain explorer can be found <a
href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer">here</a>, where you can
search for any transaction, address or block.</p>
<figure>

alt="Image of bitcoin transactions blockchain explorer" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image of bitcoin transactions blockchain
explorer</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That means no more lies and no more secrets which I think is a
massive benefit to humanity in general and the core reason why the
technology became so popular.</p>
<p>In terms of finances though, for which the Bitcoin technology was
originally intended, the biggest benefit is however the promise of
<em>zero fees, fast transactions and equality</em>, with anyone able to
receive and send currency to anyone anywhere in the world. No long bank
forms to complete, high fees and long waiting times to send money across
the border. No person excluded from the ability to send or receive
currency, including the millions of people born ‘<em>illegally</em>’ in
China (how can a living person be illegal?) when they weren’t allowed to
have more than one child, the <em>‘illegal’</em> immigrants having
risked their lives in search of a better life in a country they were not
lucky enough to be born in, or those who are restricted based on their
nationality from transacting with the rest of the world because of the
crime of a leader they don’t even support, like Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>That’s a world I want to live in and a value exchange system I will
support. Each person should have the right to participate in life so to
speak and part of that means the ability to pay and get paid.</p>
<p>If banks and our current financial systems and governments were
working well (meaning taking the best interest of the people as their
first priority) there would be no reason for people to look for
alternatives. But it isn’t working that well and it’s inevitable that it
must change. It’s no longer a question of <em>IF</em>, but
<em>WHEN</em>.</p>
<p>Digital seems like our best option going forward, and *the original*
block chain the most fair.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that we start replacing the old financial systems
with new ones and Ethereum has embarked on a journey to do just that,
quite enthusiastically, if I might say so.</p>
<p>Ethereum, however, does not restrict itself to financial transactions
like Bitcoin. You can literally put anything on the Ethereum block
chain. It is the Google Play Store on the blockchain with an app for
everything, starting with <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/are-we-ready-for-defi-16fff0c4ef37">DeFi</a>
(decentralized finance). There are also games, market places and even
job boards available with each day more apps being released.</p>
<h1 id="the-good-shared-vision-community">The good — shared vision &amp;
community</h1>
<p>Ethereum does a lot of good things that enables participation and
growing the ecosystem actively. One of the my favorite things is the
regular hackathons where people are supported to build new apps
according to a central theme. I had the pleasure of meeting and working
with some <em>exceptional</em> talent — a rare find indeed — and had
access to some of the best minds in the industry with regular organized
sessions on various topics.</p>
<p>This is an excellent learning and networking opportunity and I love
the concept of voluntary workers. When people <em>choose</em> to
participate in building something they are bound to be more creative and
build better products. Add a salary and you have a holacracy filled with
innovators and passionate creators.</p>
<p>The hackathon <em>creates community</em> and a <em>shared vision</em>
that guides participants into a desired direction, rather than just
letting everyone loose like in the Play Store, resulting in more garbage
than gold. It supports people to build their vision, and immediately
filter out the apps that isn’t quite ready with valuable feedback from
specialists. It’s a recipe for success and a model that more work places
should consider adopting.</p>
<p>One of the results of this community is low-code and no-code tools
which makes it possible for anyone to build a block chain application at
a fraction of the time that it would if you were to do everything from
scratch. If used correctly you can accelerate your product development
time and focus on what’s really important — namely building the
<em>right</em> product — rather than worrying about building the product
right. The biggest challenge (and this is a great challenge to have!) is
to find the right lego bricks and getting them to fit correctly, which
is the next huge benefit of using Ethereum.</p>
<p>The entire ecosystem is designed as a plug-and-play lego system. The
community is strengthened even more by this attitude of sharing and
re-usability, making it a <em>collaboration</em>, rather than a zero-sum
game with only one winner. People are willing to share their skills as
well as their code and expertise freely, something quite unique and
exceptional and one of the main reasons why I simply can’t let go of my
love relationship with software development.</p>
<p>The people leading the effort are extraordinary.</p>
<p>Another good thing about Ethereum is that they have already totally
replaced the financial systems as we know it and if the banks one day
stop operating, there’s already a fall-back in place and fully
functional. In fact, you can do a lot more than what you can on a
traditional bank with way more choices available and you the sole
decision maker. The number and variety of working applications are more
than what one person could possibly need, with more innovative solutions
added daily.</p>
<h1 id="the-bad-pay-to-participate">The bad —pay to participate</h1>
<p>The most visible pain point of Ethereum and a much debated topic is
the gas fees — a ‘small’ fee charged for each transaction. I’m still to
find out exactly where these fees go, but do know that a portion of it
is to fund the validation processing, or more commonly known as mining
in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Where on the BitCoin network transactions don’t charge “gas”, on the
Ethereum network each read is free, but each write will cost you gas. To
complicate matters, there is no way to calculate this gas fee until the
transaction is complete, so you never know exactly how much it will be.
The vast number of tokens also means that you probably need to do many
more transactions to complete one goal than you would, for example, when
exchanging ZAR to USD, thus compounding the effects of the gas fee even
more. This, however, is a problem much wider than Ethereum.</p>
<p><em>The impact of the gas fees on each write transaction is that
every time you actually want to do something on the Ethereum blockchain
(which in my opinion is the fundamental measure of value of anything),
you have to pay</em>. Whether it is playing a game or posting a blog, or
trade your virtual crypto kitten, it is going to cost you some gas.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, is the main reason why it is still so small
relative to the market size available.</p>
<p>The justification is that it is a small fee, only a few cents (which
in practice sometimes is and sometimes not and depends very much on your
base for cents as the South African Rand for example is much weaker than
the Dollar), and that it reduces spam. Although there is merit in this
reasoning, in practice, I don’t quite agree with it. Especially when I
see gas being burned, meaning it’s too much (from my lay person
perspective).</p>
<p>The current internet is free to use. Most digital products offer a
free option which in today’s crowded market is essential to filter out
the empty promises from the actual quality products available and to see
whether it solves your problem. Free or crowdsource means building what
matters and valuing user needs.</p>
<p>Ethereum, and block chain in general, is changing this model with
providing <em>nothing</em> for free.</p>
<p>Transactions are also not immediate and can take up to 15 minutes,
which is still an improvement when compared to a Forex bank transaction,
but breaks the promise of fast and free transactions globally.</p>
<p>Ethereum 2.0 attempts to solve both the gas fee and the transaction
speed problems, yet, from what I can see (and I know very little) the
new staking to mine is in fact excluding rather than including more
people. The argument for sharding was to make mining more accessible
without specialized and expensive hardware. At 32 ETH — which at the
time of writing this post was worth more than $12, 000 — you can buy a
few gaming PC’s, all which can currently comfortably run mining
programs. It also adds this money to be staked for a few years with
penalties. So if you don’t have a high-speed internet connection with a
permanently connected device running, you risk losing some of your
stake.</p>
<p>A less visible pain point that many people probably don’t know, is
that few of the apps are actually making money. <em>Argent</em>, a (very
good!) alternative to a fiat bank, for example subsidized the gas fees
in order to get people on board, which was of course not sustainable and
it is changing as we speak. PoolTogether, one of the most popular
savings games (and also really cool!) has not made any profit yet as
most of the Ethereum startups I came across. It rather looks and feels
like an expensive new toy for developers than a long-term and
sustainable business opportunity. But then, Amazon made losses for the
first 5 - 7 years.</p>
<p>It simply doesn’t make much business sense to put a document
management system for government on a blockchain.</p>
<h1 id="the-ugly-centralizing-decentralization">The ugly — centralizing
decentralization</h1>
<p>Ethereum might be great for a fun or personal project and to break
free from the traditional fiat systems, but by far my biggest concern
relates to the fundamental design principle of decentralization.</p>
<p>The ugly of the blockchain (DeFi specifally) is that centralized hubs
that access and store personal documents are forced at all access
points, thus breaking the most fundamental principle of the block chain,
namely decentralization. This is of course not Ethereum or any
blockchain’s fault, but still something to take into consideration.</p>
<p>It might still be easier to open a financial account in a European
run company than opening a European bank account from South Africa —
where I live — but I kept running into the same wall when randomly
choosing a wallet or exchange. South Africa is not supported, or getting
funds into my wallet is not supported with my bank account, or getting
money out is a problem. It is a similar discrimination than before based
on geographic location. Probably only because they haven’t had time to
catch up yet and hopefully this will change.</p>
<p>Most countries don’t classify crypto currencies as financial assets,
thus is not considered ‘money’ that technically requires KYC. It’s
rather the same as buying a sofa or a digital software program or car
and I don’t need to be KYC’ed in order to do that, so why for buying
crypto assets?</p>
<p>The reasons provided to justify the need for KYC relates to the
prevention of fraud and terrorism, but this seems rather superficial
seeing that all transactions are transparent on the block chain and
hiding money is far easier in fiat banks than on the block chain. KYC
hasn’t stopped drug smuggling or sex trafficking either, so it’s just
not a good enough reason for me.</p>
<p><em>But, that’s my opinion and I have a very limited perspective.
Make up your own mind.</em></p>
<p>I would just prefer that if we’re going through the effort of
rebuilding a system we do it differently, better. Currently, we’re
mostly just moving the structures that weren’t working so well to web3,
and it is breaking the very essence of the chain.</p>
<h1 id="and-the-verdict-is.">And the verdict is….</h1>
<p>For investment and trading when you have extra cash on hand I highly
recommend Ethereum as one of the strongest performers on the crypto
currency arena. The growth is higher than most other currencies and the
platform is growing exponentially and won’t stop soon.</p>
<p>For DeFi applications Ethereum is a great alternative to fiat banking
even though it only makes sense for larger transactions. Daily
transactions simply doesn’t justify the cost of gas. Until you can’t buy
bread and milk using crypto it won’t be globally accepted as a solution
to fiat.</p>
<p>For building a business venture or startup that is not financial in
nature, Ethereum is most probably not the best choice of technology,
however. There are many other blockchains that is faster, cheaper, and
more scalable.</p>
<p>For a document processing and storage solution provided free of
charge and with high usage by the general public, Ethereum would
definitely not be my recommendation. Each individual will have to create
a wallet and fund for each transaction, which is more expensive and more
difficult than the current paper process in place. To process each
document there will need to be an estimate of 3–5 transactions at least,
which means that it will in fact cost more than the paper trails
currently in use.</p>
<p>There are of course benefits, including the permanence of records and
inability to tamper with it, more accurate and real-time statistics
available and more, but this can be done on existing technology.</p>
<p>So even in a digital world, sometimes it makes more sense to go with
low-tech or no-tech to improve a user experience. Just because you can,
doesn’t mean you should. <em>Only digitize if it is an
improvement.</em></p>

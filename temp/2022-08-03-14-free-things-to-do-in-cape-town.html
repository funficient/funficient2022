    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="because-the-best-things-in-life-are-free">Because the best
things in life are free</h2>
<p>I have been a travel junkie for a while now and as I spent more and
more time being a tourist, the initial excitement of being bombarded
with someone trying to sell me something in the developing countries I
so love to visit, turned first into a mild annoyance, then into an
extreme frustration. The over-commercial and populated recommendations
from the travel books and agents felt more like exploitation than value
for money. You get to pay premium prices to see crowds of people and be
rushed from one attraction to the next ending up needing a holiday to
recover from the holiday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There had to be a better way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started looking for alternatives and was pleasantly surprised to
discover that the free things on offer are often the best! Where the
more touristy attractions are usually overpriced, overbooked and a
magnet for gold diggers in search of unsuspecting prey (also called
tourists), the free attractions are mostly free from these annoyances.
The money seekers seem to avoid you when you do free things as they
assume you don’t have the money to buy anything. The people hosting
these free events usually small, unique and trying to gain traction in
an overpopulated world. They end up being more creative, give more
delightful service and products and care about my opinion. Perfect!</p>
<p>So here is my top list of free things to do in Cape Town:</p>
<h2 id="walk-the-labyrinth-at-st-georges-cathedral">1. Walk the
Labyrinth at St George’s Cathedral</h2>
<p>Right in the middle of Cape Town’s city center and at the end of a
long walkway with a selection of local arts and crafts and other things
to sell — including some scrumptious food for the hungry - is an old
cathedral with a labyrinth hidden at the back of the cathedral in the
cloisters area.</p>
<p>Spend some time contemplating in the quiet solitude of the cathedral
while admiring the stained glass windows and architecture before heading
out towards the cloisters. Inside you will find a small rose garden
neighboring the magnificent Company Gardens and a labyrinth which is
only open to the public in the mornings.</p>
<p>Be sure to also pop into the bric-a-brac and second hand bookstore on
the property for a selection of interesting and sometimes quite
extraordinary books.</p>
<h2 id="visit-the-company-gardens">2. Visit the Company Gardens</h2>
<p>Right next to the St George’s Cathedral is the splendid company
gardens where you can stroll around and learn a little bit of the
history of South Africa or feed the squirrels.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_lHZ09pxHAj9z-_tNhfHTw.jpeg" /></p>
<p>A walk through the Company Gardens</p>
<p>The company gardens were one of the first establishments in Cape Town
supplying the ships of fresh produce. To this day it remains one of the
best kept gardens in the city and a feast for the eye with the lush and
vast greenery and architecture dating back to the Victorian age.</p>
<p>Feed the squirrels, enjoy the architecture, relax over a cup of
coffee, stroll through the variety of different gardens, or visit one of
the many museums on the property. On Sundays there is a craft market
where less privileged artist are supported and helped to build a
business by the organizer of the market. For those looking to make a
difference, this is how it’s done. By buying direct from up-and-coming
young artists who are investing in their own career.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-picnic-in-green-point-park">3. Have a Picnic in Green
Point Park</h2>
<p>Even more magnificent for the nature lover is the Green Point Park,
next to the Stadium between the city center and the promenade.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*q3waHBx7PKqE6tFgw5CD7g.jpeg" /></p>
<p>A view on the Stadium from Green Point Park</p>
<p>The park is a playground for families over the weekends on the lush
green lawns with plenty of trees for shade. It also offers fun
educational sections teaching children about biodiversity.</p>
<p>Amidst the vast lawns there is another labyrinth (yeah!) with
rosemary walls (double yeah!) and a coffee shop. There’s even water
points for doggies (and humans) to cool down from the harsh African
sun.</p>
<p>This lavish patch of green haven in the dense concrete jungle of the
city of Cape Town is a welcome rest point after a day of exploring in
the city.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yakq5CockZ81DlinKHgneg.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Sea Point Promenade overlooking Robben Island, the home of Mandela
where he spent a large part of his life imprisoned.</p>
<h2 id="enjoy-jogging-on-the-sea-point-promenade">4. Enjoy Jogging on
the Sea Point promenade</h2>
<p>The promenade stretches all the way from Sea Point to the V &amp; A
Waterfront, the main shopping emporium for mostly tourists in Cape Town.
Enjoy running on the promenade while listening to the waves crashing on
one side and appreciating outdoor sculptures and exhibitions on the
other.</p>
<p>There is also an outdoor gym free for use to stretch those muscles
and build some strength to help balance the cardio from the run. For
family’s there are a few spots dedicated to play areas for children
making it a suitable stop for all walks of life.</p>
<h2 id="enjoy-firstthursdays">5. Enjoy <a
href="http://first-thursdays.co.za/">#firstthursdays</a></h2>
<p>Every first Thursday of the month all the art galleries and other
interesting shops and markets stay open until 9pm to allow and invite
mostly locals who work to enjoy the cultural aspect of the city they
live in.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6ps6GGlVlL6osIDFoxzbhQ.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Youngblood art gallery and food spot</p>
<p>It’s not only for locals though. It’s a great tourist outing so make
sure to pick up your free map and discover the young talent of this
international design capital and enjoy a (free) glass of wine at select
places.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UX8bvAQbdkaBAWLDlc6xpQ.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Mungo handwoven quality crafts.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites on the map include <a
href="http://youngblood-africa.com/whats-on/">Youngblood,</a> an arts
and cultural development program, with a range of exhibitions in this
extraordinary building. If you’re not into art, enjoy the architecture
or order food and something to drink at the Food Area.</p>
<p>Another favorite and special place to visit is <a
href="http://www.mungo.co.za/">Mungo’s</a>, a working museum where you
can watch how high quality clothes, cloths and other fabrics are weaved
from organic cotton, bamboo and more in an old weaving machine. Not only
is it high quality made to last a lifetime, it’s also earth friendly and
lovely to look at and feel.</p>
<p>Mullers Optometrist is another worthy spot to pop into, a functional
optometrist and museum with art exhibitions on the second floor of this
beautiful piece of architecture.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t have to only be here on the first
Thursday of the month as the shops and galleries are open year
round.</p>
<h2 id="learn-to-kitesurf">6. Learn to Kitesurf</h2>
<p>Cape Town is windy. Very windy. When Chicago was branded as the windy
city, Cape Town was probably not discovered yet. I’ve been to both and
Cape Town’s wind are by far the, mmmm, <em>windiest</em> wind I’ve come
across.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GICazoWiFqUpT9CXkQT33w.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Enjoy a free introductory kitesurf lesson on the beautiful white
sandy beaches of Table View. Picture by SA Kitesurf.</p>
<p>This can ruin your holiday, or you can make lemonade when given
lemons. And o, how sweet the lemonade here is!</p>
<p>In Cape Town, surrendering to the wind and making the most of a windy
day and cold ocean means surfing, or for the more adventurous,
kitesurfing.</p>
<p>The friendly and competent team from <a
href="http://www.sakitesurf.co.za/">SA Kitesurf</a> offers a free
introductory lesson every Sunday morning during season covering the
basics of what to expect and give you a chance to try out flying a kite
on the windy beaches of Cape Town.</p>

<p>Having abseiled, paraglided, skydived, scuba-dived and with a motto
of try everything once, kitesurfing is by far the most enticing, most
adventurous, most fun value-for-money activity I’ve come across. All you
need is a wetsuit and basic gear, an ocean and a bit of wind.</p>
<p>Love it? Join a 5-day course which includes a trip to the beautiful
Langebaan on the west coast — South Africa’s version of the Greek
Islands — and be forever free to conquer the air and the ocean in an
exhilarating ride where the earth meets the sky.</p>
<p>The good news is that they are also based in Oregan and Florida, USA,
allowing you to learn at home and continue your adventure abroad.</p>
<h2 id="relax-on-the-white-sandy-beaches-of-table-view">7. Relax on the
white sandy beaches of Table View</h2>
<p>If you’re not the adventurous type, Table View, aptly named, is the
perfect stretch of beach for a long walk while taking in the best views
of Table Mountain, one of the 7 natural wonders of the world.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZwTwiiOeLDa5LUCaLBpwDA.jpeg" /></p>
<p>A walk on the beach with Table Mountain in the background.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I love Cape Town is because you don’t have to
choose between the mountain or the beach. This is the city of abundance,
offering something of everything. One of the reasons why I love Table
View is because it’s one of the few beaches in Cape Town where you can
just relax and let your hair down. Compared to the flashy and viby
Clifton and Camps Bay, Table View has no pretense and there’s space to
breathe.</p>
<p>There are a range of restaurants and bars across the street from the
beach, making it the perfect hide-out to rejuvenate and restore for the
year ahead.</p>
<h2 id="hike-up-lions-head">8. Hike Up Lion’s Head</h2>
<p>Lion’s Head, the hill next to Table Mountain looking like the rump of
a lion when viewed from a certain angle, is one of the best free things
to do in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The hike up is mostly easy and can be done by most, offering a choice
of shortest or easiest at one point in the hike. As always, however, I
chose challenging over easy and ended up conquering my fear of heights
navigating my much too short body up stretches of mountain only
supported with chains to keep you from falling.</p>
<p>Enjoy the spectacular view of Cape Town from the top before heading
down again.</p>
<p>The only downside is that the only way to get there is with taxi or
Uber as it’s not serviced by the MyCiti buses, as most of the tourist
attractions in Cape Town. There are also fullmoon hikes to allow you to
see the sun set from the top.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*d6CzaFvKoKA33fU3DDPUsA.jpeg" /></p>
<h2 id="touch-the-berlin-wall">9. Touch The Berlin Wall</h2>
<p>Hidden in plain sight is a piece of the Berlin Wall, given to Mandela
years ago and now housed in public at the end of St George’s Mall, right
on the corner before crossing Wale Street to St George’s Cathedral (I’m
still wondering why St George seems to be so influential with so many
parts named after him).</p>
<p>The one side, assumed to have been on the east side, is filled with
colorful graffiti while the opposite side is mostly white and clean,
symbolizing the difference between the two sides. Both beautiful in its
own way, I do enjoy the more expressive east side more.</p>
<h2 id="photograph-the-buzzing-bo-kaap">10. Photograph the Buzzing
Bo-Kaap</h2>
<p>Another expressionist area, and my favorite place in Cape Town, is
the Bo-Kaap (literally translated to upper Cape and previously known as
the Malay Quarter). Read more about the <a

of the architecture</a> here.</p>

<p>Beautiful Bo-Kaap.</p>
<p>Originally built for artisans and later occupied by liberated slaves,
the colorful houses (to me) symbolize freedom and liberation and
self-expression. It reminds me of all the communist countries I’ve
visited where once government controlled housing are painted in bright
colors after breaking free from the domination and control of the
authorities. When I roam through the colorful streets I feel strong,
free, and alive. I love it.</p>
<p>Pop into the local shops to enjoy the traditional Malay food, usually
a pastry with spices and coconut, originating from the spice nation who
were the main influencers of this area. Or visit one of the designer
shops in upper Wale street and see a good collection of some of the best
artifacts that Cape Town has to offer, including products from the <a
href="https://medium.com/hotfoot/12-reasons-for-digital-nomads-to-visit-observatory-woodstock-cape-town-513093789044">3
Cats Brand produced by Mnandi Textiles</a> as written about in another
post, custom jewellery inspired by the insects of Africa and strong and
sturdy bags made from recycled boat sails by SeaLife. Not only good for
the earth, but beautiful too.</p>

<p>Graffiti art.</p>
<h2 id="discover-graffiti-and-art">11. Discover Graffiti and Art</h2>
<p>Cape Town is filled with treasures in unexpected corners. All you
have to do is open your eyes and sometimes look up. There is graffiti
art on buildings, outdoor sculptures in numerous places and seasonal
outdoor exhibitions, making it impossible not to discover something
extraordinary.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Lc3Dl0g8etHUydrRu04YXw.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Be sure to keep your eyes open while walking down Sea Point
Promenade, and do pop by Church Square, a patch of mostly nothingness
behind the bustling city center, currently with an exhibition dedicated
to the current drought and making people more aware of being more water
wise.</p>
<p>A rainbow made of water pipes and sun loungers of all different
colors on synthetic lawn creates a welcome oasis with a magnificent
sculpture of siamese twins in the background.</p>
<p>However, this made me wonder who stole the water and what the truth
behind this shortage really is, as there’s absolutely no logical reason
for being in drought.</p>
<p>There has been ample time for government to take preventative action
(and by ample I mean years), there is more than enough technology around
to resolve the problem, and it’s ironic that the drought is in one of
the most abundant water areas of the country, being surrounded by ocean
on all sides and home of one of the biggest underground sources of water
in Table Mountain. To me, it looks like yet a (sneaky) method to get
more taxes and instill more fear. I seriously question the authority’s
ability to govern if they’re not even able to provide
<strong><em>the</em></strong> most basic resource of all.</p>
<h2 id="join-a-meetup">12. Join a Meetup</h2>
<p>The best way to integrate into the local culture, create an
international network or learn something new is to find a <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>There’s literally something for everyone but some of my favorites
include joining game nights, listen to tech talks, join fellow
entrepreneurs in Lean (Startup) Coffee sessions and one of my best
discoveries to date was joining a free kiteboarding lesson on Table View
(above in more detail).</p>
<p>It gives more insight into the culture, allows you to connect with
like-minded people and learn something new. Often there are free snacks
and drinks included as an extra incentive to join, but mostly I enjoy
the opportunity to diversify my network, discover new trends and
connecting with like-minded people. I’ve made plenty of friends and
uncovered loads of insights through meetups and remain a dedicated
Meetup-per in all the countries I’ve been.</p>
<h2 id="play-a-game-at-the-box-cafe">13. Play a Game at the Box
Cafe</h2>
<p>Strangely, at the time of writing this article this trendy city homes
only one boardgame cafe. Hopefully that will change soon, but for the
moment, the <a href="http://thebigbox.co.za/">Big Box Cafe</a> is the
only coffee shop and board game store where you can eat, play and buy
board games.</p>
<p>There is a stack of board games to choose from, mostly the more known
games and more for the fun seeker than the discerning gamer, in a small
setting with space for only small groups or families.</p>

<h2 id="discover-the-oldest-grape-vine-in-the-southern-hemisphere">14.
Discover the Oldest Grape Vine In The Southern Hemisphere</h2>
<p><em>Originally planted in 1771, this very special vine right in the
center of town, still produces wine nearly 250 years later.</em></p>
<p>It’s housed in the courtyard of the Heritage Square, a co-op with a
tasteful selection of art, food, wine, and more.</p>
<p>Simply take the time to grasp the uniqueness and wonder of the vine,
or sit down over a cup of coffee, ice cream, wine or join a gin tasting
upstairs.</p>
<p>Take the time to walk around the property and soak in the
architecture with rough textured walls in carved stone and bricks,
original wooden floors and exquisite doors and other finishes.</p>
<h1 id="not-all-good-things-are-free">Not All Good Things Are Free</h1>
<p>I simply can’t write about all the extraordinary things in Cape Town
without mentioning <a
href="https://granddaddy.co.za/play-and-eat/rooftop-cinema">Grand
Daddy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="enjoy-an-outdoor-movie">15. Enjoy an Outdoor Movie</h2>
<p>This is one of my most spectacular finds in Cape Town, even though
it’s not free for so many reasons.</p>
<p>The architecture and tasteful interior makes this worth the visit in
itself, with an old wooden elevator still fully operational.</p>
<p>The rooftop offers one of the better rooftop bar on offer where you
can enjoy the sunset under the African sky.</p>
<p>On Monday’s and Wednesdays an outdoor cinema is hosted with prices
(at the time of writing December 2017) starting from R120 per
ticket.</p>

<p>Rooftop Safari at Grand Daddy’s.</p>
<p>Too lazy to walk down? No problem, there are old trailers transformed
into comfortable rooms complete with on-suite shower and toilet.</p>
<p>Each trailer is decorated in a unique and viby African style, well
laid out to maximize the available space to make for a unique yet
comfortable night out.</p>
<p>Looking for more comfort? There are a range of spacious, beautifully
decorated and comfortable rooms downstairs in one of the best locations
in town. There is also a fine dining experience downstairs making it
possible to stay an entire weekend without having to leave the
premises.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of town you’re only a step away from the variety
of art and culture, the beachfront, the mountain and everything else,
which makes it one of my favorite places in Cape Town and worth a
mention.</p>

<h2 id="allowing-users-to-appreciate-value">Allowing users to appreciate
value</h2>
<p>If, 10 years ago, someone would have proposed a business model where
employees are charged, as apposed to being paid, higher than average
prices in exchange to travel at their own expense to do work most people
don’t want to do, most people would have said you’re crazy. It will
<em>never</em> work.</p>
<p>Yet, volunteering took the world by storm and continues to be one of
the best business models around. People are literally standing in queues
to pay more than they would for a much more luxurious holiday to work in
a developing country at their own expense while contributing to the
project on top of covering all their costs. There’s no sign that
volunteering is decreasing and it remains as popular as it was when it
was initially launched. <em>Why?</em> Because it is <em>meaningful</em>.
It is <em>real</em>. It makes a <em>tangible impact</em> compared to the
average day-job where most people have never met their customers or
sometimes even their CEO.</p>
<p>If, 5 years ago someone would propose a business model where your
profit would be as a result of selling something that you don’t own,
people would say you’re crazy. It’s impossible!</p>
<p>Yet, AirBnB quickly became the biggest holiday accommodation provider
worldwide while owning no property and Uber remains the biggest taxi
service, owning no taxis. <em>Why?</em> Because it provides a more
affordable, more personalized, <em>human</em> and <em>homely</em> travel
experience compared to the overpriced hotels where you’re isolated,
disconnected and lonely in a room designed by people who have never
lived there. It’s the difference between being treated as just another
customer and being treated as a valued friend.</p>
<p>If, 20 years ago someone said that people would be willing to pay
more in exchange for less functionality, most people would have said
you’re crazy. Yet, Apple proved that usability and intuitive design is
more important to the average user than the sheer volume of functions
available in an application. Compared to Microsoft, they offered a
fraction of the functionality for more than double the price tag.
<em>Why did it work?</em> Because Apple understood that <em>it’s not
about giving more, but giving what is useful.</em> Having a plethora of
options that doesn’t solve the problem you have, you can’t find or don’t
know how to use it, it is as useless as not having it at all. Actually,
worse.</p>
<p><em>If, a few years ago someone would propose to give away all their
products for free, people would have said you’re crazy. It can never
work! Yet, Google and Facebook remain two of the largest and most
profitable tech companies with most of their products for free.</em>
<em>Why?</em> Because they understood that it’s not only about trying to
sell something, it’s about having access to the network and meeting a
need.</p>
<h2 id="allowing-over-demanding">Allowing Over Demanding</h2>
<p>In my <strong><a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/a-teal-manifesto-68347d90957">teal
manifesto</a></strong>, an article proposing a set of four values
defining the future of organizations, the first value proposed is
<em>purpose over profit</em>, where the meaning behind why you are doing
what you are doing should be more important than simply focusing on
making more money.</p>
<p>To expand on this vision, I propose another value to help guide the
choice of business model. The value being** <em>allowing</em> customers
to appreciate <em>value</em> over <em>demanding</em> a set
<em>price</em>**.</p>
<p>Seems crazy? Maybe.</p>
<p>But it’s been around in more subtle forms for years and all I’ve seen
is growth in popularity. Examples include a book publishing platform
called LeanPub, which allows the author to set the price range and the
user to choose how much they pay within this range.</p>
<p>Another example includes the tourism industry with the concept of
Free Walking Tours, where people are asked for donations at the end of
the tour. A few years ago I joined one of these tours and ended up
paying more than the guideline price they suggested simply because it
was such an amazing experience. Today, there are more tours on offer in
more locations, which indicates that this model is working.</p>
<p>Firefox, a web browser, is another example how such a model can work.
The browser is offered free of charge and each time you open the browser
you’re given the option to donate money.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it seems crazy to expect customers to pay for
something they don’t even know they will like, or charge the same for
good quality and bad quality based on the category of product. Why
should a bad tour guide be paid as much as a good one? Why should a good
quality book cost the same as a bad quality one? <em>Why should you as
user take 100% of the risk paying for a product or service before you’ve
even tried it? It seems unrealistic to me to expect the user to pay the
same price for a crappy movie and an excellent one, when most people
won’t accept paying the same for a crappy meal vs a really good
one.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-allowing">The Art Of Allowing</h2>
<p>The most inspiring example of how well this works is how a goal of
$100 000 exceeded expectations resulting in $1.2 million in funding.
Such a return on investment could never be possible only by cutting
costs or increasing sales. Watch the video below to find out how asking
for support rather than demanding a fee resulted in this crowdfunding
goal to be exceeded exponentially above expectations.</p>
<p>In Amanda Palmer’s TED Talk called “The art of asking”, she explains
why she supports torrenting, illegal downloads and giving away her music
for free.</p>

Palmer: The art of asking</a></p>
<p>This famous musician started her career as a street performer,
offering a flower and intense eye-contact to by-passers in exchange for
coins as she stood still, painted white and dressed as a bride, on a box
in the street.</p>
<p>At the end of the TED talk she mentions how a fan gave her money at
the end of a live performance for a CD he downloaded illegally years
ago. <em>It struck me how much sense this made.</em> Allowing people to
become a fan and give you money based on their perceived value of your
offering. This guy burned <em>one</em> CD illegally. The loss in revenue
probably only being a few dollars (or even cents) at the time. He loved
the music so much though that he not only paid her for the full cost of
the CD directly to her, but also a much more expensive ticket to a live
performance. Most likely, he continues to pay for her music and
performances years later and shares it with friends who probably do the
same.</p>
<h2 id="currency-for-success">Currency For Success</h2>
<p>I decided to try the model out, offering to work for free the last
couple of years. The results were unexpected, with some failures and
some successes, but it allowed me to refine a model which I truly
believe can work in the mainstream business environment and give
startups an unfair advantage over their competitors using more
traditional models.</p>
<p>Here are the principles I have found needs to be in place for it to
work:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Give before you ask for something in return.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Traditionally, the price of a project is negotiated and set before
work starts. In most cases, being per hour. This sounds good in
principle, yet in practice I can’t think of a worse approach.</p>
<p>From science and research we know that people always underestimate
effort. We are guaranteed that <em>something</em> unexpected will happen
which will force a change in the plan, no matter how good the plan is.
We know that at the start of the project we know the least. We also know
that what gets measured gets done, so if you measure time, <em>time</em>
is what you will get, while results is what you actually want.</p>
<p>Deciding how much to pay per hour at the onset of a project when you
most probably don’t even understand the need yet thus makes little
sense. What makes much more sense is doing the work and then asking for
remuneration based on the value provided, not the hours spent.</p>
<p>For that to work however, you need something else.</p>
<p><strong>2. Clarify expectations and boundaries.</strong></p>
<p>Customer service is as easy as setting realistic expectations and
meeting those expectations consistently. Being happy as a service
provider requires exactly the same. On the onset of the project clarify
the expectations and boundaries, leaving out the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Unstated needs only breed resentment and content.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explicitly specify success criteria and expected reward. Explicitly
define failure criteria and when you are not willing or when it becomes
unreasonable to collaborate.</p>
<p>As opposed to setting the hourly rate or the duration of the project,
however, rather specify the expected <em>outcomes</em> and define a
reward process. For example, your basic costs are covered and when you
meet a specific and quantified target (such as doubling the sales),
regardless of how long it takes, you are paid x% commission and for
above average performance open up the possibility for a voluntary
increase or bonus payout.</p>
<p>Make sure you know what the industry averages are and provide that as
baseline to aid the decision making process, similar to knowing that 10%
tip at a restaurant indicates average service. Tipping less indicates
the service did not meet expectations, tipping more indicates that
service exceeded expectations.</p>
<p><strong>3. Shorten feedback loops and define a feedback
process.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the previous point, agree on a feedback <em>process</em>
with as short as possible feedback loops, especially in the beginning
when there are still a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>Contrary to traditional projects where the contract is negotiated
fully before work commences, focus on alignment between the customer and
the service provider. Initiate feedback sessions first daily, then
weekly, then fortnightly as you get to know the customer better and
build trust. <em>Never, however leave speaking to each other for longer
than 2 weeks at a time.</em> Talking to each other once a month is
simply not enough and a weekly check-in is advised. Just because you
were aligned next week doesn’t guarantee you will remain in alignment.
Remaining in alignment is like driving a car, you need to keep your eyes
on the road even if you know the road.</p>
<p>Agree on a conflict resolution process and identify an objective
external mediator who can be called in when needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t try to avoid conflict, try to find a safe space to engage in
conflict, as conflict is what is necessary to push through the
boundaries that’s held you back in the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The focus is to allow as little deviation from reaching the
<em>mutual</em> goal as possible by ensuring continuous feedback to
re-evaluate the progress.</p>
<p><strong>4. Treat everyone as a VIP.</strong></p>
<p>In a traditional organization there is a clearly defined hierarchy.
The CEO is at the top, the directors directly beneath him or her and so
forth. Your importance is reflected on the label in front of your name.
The norm, sadly, has become to sacrifice the needs of the people lower
down the food chain in an attempt to please those higher up the food
chain. Those at the top are treated as if nothing they can do or say is
wrong, while everything those at the bottom say that contradicts or
questions the top is wrong.</p>
<p>The flaw in this model is that the hierarchy is defined and followed
only partly by the organization. There is a more subtle, more powerful
influence layer beneath this consisting out of <em>true</em>
influencers, not necessarily with the label to go with it though. True
influencers are driven by passion, not power. They truly <em>care</em>
about their domain, not about being right.</p>
<p>In practice, people in an organization will abide by the rules of the
authorities with the labels associated with the role — like manager or
director — but they more respect and look for answer to the influencers.
Mostly, these influencers are also the advisors of the directors and
managers, thus it is more important to identify and respect these
influencers than the ones with the labels appointing them as authority
figures.</p>
<p>The influencing, however, mostly happens very subtly, without people
being aware of it. Often the influencers themselves aren’t even aware of
their level of influence.</p>
<p>Assuming that you don’t know who is truly influential in an
organization, or who someone is to become later in their career, treat
<em>everyone</em> as a VIP. The difficult customers as well as the easy
ones. The important and rich as well as the bootstrapping startup which
might turn out to become a unicorn.</p>
<p><strong>5. Focus on value and results.</strong></p>
<p>Already touched on in point number 2 above, focus on solving a
problem and delivering value fast and continuously rather than doing
what the customer told you to do.</p>
<p>In most cases I’ve seen to date, people don’t know what they need.
They know they have a problem and they articulate this problem by
providing a possible solution. However, <em>you can’t solve a problem on
the same level as where it was created</em> so 99.9% of the time this
proposed solution is ineffective or only addresses part of the
problem.</p>
<p>Rather than blindly doing as the customer asked, ask what the problem
is that needs to be solved and <em>why</em> they need this proposed
solution. What are they trying to achieve? Even better, quietly observe
and identify the problem.</p>
<p>For example, someone might say that they need a good sales person to
increase sales, yet on deeper investigation it is noticed that it is the
product that needs changing and the skills of a good product owner, not
more sales is what is needed. Or that the logistics are inhibiting
growth or distribution and that a supply chain specialist might solve
the deeper problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don’t do what you are asked to do, understand why you are asked
to do it and focus on solving the problem, not checking a list of
to-do’s.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>If you want your business to grow exponentially, increasing price and
decreasing costs are very old and restrictive ways to solve the problem.
Money is merely a neutral medium for value exchange and when you cut
costs usually the quality declines and with that the value. When you
increase price without also increasing the value proposition, the
perceived value of the exchange inherently declines and with that your
long-term growth.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on profit, it is thus a much more effective
approach to focus on <em>value</em> and view payment as feedback, as a
waiter would looking at his tip. When people are not willing to pay for
a service, it allows you to analyze why and improve your value
proposition. When customers are paying more than you asked for, it
allows you to do more of the same and increase your wealth
exponentially, far more than you could ever do with a set yearly
increase.</p>
<p>Allowing people to pay does however require a change in
infrastructure, which I’ll address in the next post, so be sure to keep
reading.</p>

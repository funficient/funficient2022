    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">Top 10 ingredients of fun</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

<p>You’ve read the books, you’ve played the games, you’ve even done a
course or two on employee engagement, happiness and gamification, yet
the one thing that remains vague and elusive is a clear definition of
fun.</p>
<p>It’s feels more like playing the lotto getting it right than a
scientific and actionable theory that you can implement.</p>
<p>If, with the emphasis on if, you hit the jackpot, you’re payout is
big, but most people don’t. It’s all about luck, and you don’t seem to
have a lot of it.</p>
<p>What exactly makes something fun? How do you add fun into the
workplace, or engage employees and customers? How do you get people to
enjoy what they are doing?</p>
<p>These questions and more curiously kept nagging me so I decided to
embark on an experiment to define a theory of fun.</p>
<h1 id="eat.-play.-love.">Eat. Play. Love.</h1>
<p>I spent the next three years playing and analysing fun in different
contexts and settings. I played with children, I played with adults. I
played indoors, outdoors, with and without technology, I played while
commuting and brought play into the classroom. Everywhere I went I
looked at my experience through a lens of fun.</p>
<p>And then the answer came. Simple. Straightforward. Easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The only true requirement for fun is to be relaxed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you go out for dinner with friends while on holiday, it’s fun.
When you have to go to a company dinner when all you want to do is kick
off your shoes and read a book at home after an exhausting day at work,
it’s not.</p>
<p>When you go to the local markets while on holiday in the South of
France looking for fresh bread and cheese for lunch, it’s fun; when you
have to get the weekly groceries between work and picking up the
children from school, it’s not fun.</p>
<p>The more stress, the less fun. The more relaxed, the more fun.</p>
<h1 id="a-theory-of-fun">A theory of fun</h1>
<p>But that’s as un-scientific and un-do able, so I’ve come up with a
list of the top 10 reasons why something is considered fun, in no
particular order.</p>
<h2
id="its-fun-because-it-provides-a-safe-environment-to-experiment.">1.
It’s fun because it provides a safe environment to experiment.</h2>
<p><em>Compared with ‘real’ life, when you play there are no serious
repercussions if you make a mistake or change your mind.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Actually, the bigger the mistake, the funnier it is.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s no expectations and no judgement from your play mates.
Whether you are the cop or the robber, it is neither good nor bad, it is
simply trying out a different perspective.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-it-actively-engages-your-imagination.">2. It’s fun if
it actively engages your imagination.</h2>
<p>Children seem to enjoy something when it actively engages their
imagination and allows them to be the creator of their own universe. The
same is true for adults, who couldn’t stop talking about superheroe’s
and Star Wars for months on end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The more ridiculous and impossible, the better.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Whether you are drawing, daydreaming, or playing with friends,
imagination is an essential ingredient for fun. Creating is the true
purpose of having a mind.</em></p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-you-can-move.">3. It’s fun if you can move.</h2>
<p>Except for drawing (which involves the use of imagination), I haven’t
seen a lot of examples where children have fun without movement.</p>
<p>Similarly, adults are happier when they move around. Whether it is
shopping, travelling, or simply going for a stroll, activities involving
movement are more fun than those where you have to sit still for
prolonged periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Maybe that’s why Wii was such a success?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding music is even better (see the next ingredient), but whether it
is dance, exercise or simply playing Simon Says, movement seems to be
the most overlooked and essential ingredient of fun.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-it-engages-all-your-senses.">4. It’s fun if it
engages all your senses.</h2>
<p>Good games are excellent tools for escaping the harsh reality of
daily life (Jane McGonigal wrote an excellent book exploring this
subject called Reality is Broken).</p>
<p>We play games at the end of a hard day at work, to pass the time
waiting for the train, or because we’re bored at home.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Games force you to stop thinking for a moment and is much easier
than meditation to learn.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you play a game, especially a fast game (fighting games, racing
games etc.), it is impossible to think of anything else and you need
your eyes, ears and fingers all on red hot alert to stay alive.</p>
<p>A mind refresher and modern day meditation. The more senses involved,
the better the experience.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-you-can-connect-socially.">5. It’s fun if you can
connect socially.</h2>
<p>Connect. Share. Belong.</p>
<p>Whether you are playing a boardgame with friends, or a videogame
alone at home, social connection is an important reason for having
fun.</p>
<p>It’s not about the people, it’s about the connection. Feeling
validated. Feeling accepted by those around you.</p>
<p>I’ve tried playing games with strangers and it was enjoyable, but by
far not as much fun as with familiar friends. A game is fun when you can
share a joke and isn’t scared to raise your views of politics or
religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s more fun when you can laugh with the person opposite
you.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-you-can-get-better.">6. It’s fun if you can get
better.</h2>
<p>Growth. Evolution. Mastery. Autonomy. Purpose.</p>
<p>Not only are they the ingredients for motivation, they are also the
reason why something is considered fun.</p>
<p>Games are in essence the process of mastering a skill incrementally
and at your own pace. There is no set curriculum and no hard deadline,
yet there is a clear goal and constant feedback as to your progress. And
you are guaranteed success, it just takes a little bit longer for some
people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You are at all times in control of your own learning.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t have to wait a year for your performance appraisal and
increase, and you don’t have to follow a pre-defined career development
plan. And most of all, you’re not forced to stay in a position which
isn’t where you really want to be because it’s company policy.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-it-involves-something-unknown.">7. It’s fun if it
involves something unknown.</h2>
<p>Change. Surprise. New. Fresh. Different.</p>
<p>Linked to the ability to learn something new, learning is only fun
when you are introduced with something new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Deep down, we love change and the unknown.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speed lottery game, musical stairs, the world’s deepest trash bin
— they’re all fun because it is unexpected, unusual.</p>
<p>Similarly meeting someone new and interesting at a party, discovering
a new place or thing that interests you, or learning a new skill is all
fun.</p>
<p>It’s especially fun if you can tell other people about it and thus
gain social currency with your friends.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-its-easy.">8. It’s fun if it’s easy.</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, life is much more enjoyable if it is
easy.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean boring or lacking adrenaline and passion, rather it
means that the process is smooth, efficient, well thought through.</p>
<p>I’ve had fun skydiving with my body pumping with adrenaline, but I’ve
also had a fun experience applying for a Chinese visa because it was so
stress-free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The keyword is efficiency.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that translates into optimal use of time and resources. No
unnecessary waiting, no redoing the same thing twice, no going to the
same place twice (unless it’s the start and end point), no unnecessary
detours.</p>
<p>It’s a state of being in “flow”, where you are neither bored nor
filled with anxiety. Easy, not boring.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-you-see-results.">9. It’s fun if you see
results.</h2>
<p>There’s nothing as demotivating as working on something without
seeing the results. Results and feedback make something more enjoyable.
The more regular, the better.</p>
<p>When you can tangibly share something to prove your experience
socially, it’s more fun.</p>
<p>Whether it is a photo or blog post on social media, or a useless
knick-knack you bought on your trip, it’s more fun if you can touch it
and show it to someone else.</p>
<p>It’s not so much about the social connection here, it’s more about
reliving the memory and physical proof of your experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Seeing is believing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you tell someone about your holiday, it is so much more vivid if
you can show a photo or piece of clothing that you bought while
traveling.</p>
<h2 id="its-fun-if-its-your-choice.">10. It’s fun if it’s your
choice.</h2>
<p>Voluntary. Free. Options. Choice.</p>
<p>This ingredient is so obvious that I nearly overlooked it. But as I
was walking home after I finished working on a project, I realized that
I really had fun!</p>
<p>I love my work, and I only say yes to projects and people that evoke
a very clear ‘Yes!’ when I speak to them. That means that I have full
control of my day — how much I work, with whom I work, and which
projects I work on. Most things I do are voluntary. It’s my choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You can not tell someone to have fun.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s only fun if it’s free to choose. No activity, place, or person
makes anyone happy. But if you choose the place, person or activity,
chances are that you will have more fun doing it.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>To gamify a workplace, marketing solution, or system, the key is to
find the fun. Once you have a blueprint, all you need to do is apply
some of the elements to transform boring into engaging.</p>
<p>So what does fun look like? And how can you make something that is
not fun more engaging?</p>
<p>In essence, it’s about removing stress and inducing a state of flow,
while satisfying intrinsic motivators. The more relaxed you are, the
more fun you have, but the top 10 ingredients are elements that can
reduce stress.</p>
<p>How do you have fun in your life?</p>

<h1 class="title">The essence of productivity</h1>

<h2 id="rethinking-efficiency">Rethinking efficiency</h2>
<p>Most productivity improvements in knowledge work environments focus
only on efficiency.</p>
<p>Many teams measure productivity by looking at tangible things
like<br />
<em>effort</em>, <em>competence</em>, and <em>environmental
factors</em>. Typically, to increase capacity they add more people. Or
maybe they hire senior people in the hope to increase competence. Or
maybe they invest in expensive equipment and productivity tools. Or, the
introduce more granular metrics to improve estimations.</p>
<p>The focus is on standardizing processes and reducing variance.
Something that worked well in the industrial age where products were
things like cars or telephones where quality was partly measured by the
ability to re-create the same thing as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Although there is a place for these things, the most productive thing
you can possibly do in the age of knowledge workers, though, where the
quality of products are measured by innovation and usefulness, is to
align your team, strengthen the relationships, and develop enough
autonomy and ownership so that decision making can be better, and
faster.</p>
<h2 id="swimming-upstream">Swimming upstream</h2>
<p>When even one person in your team is proverbially swimming upstream
from the rest, it introduces friction which slows down progress.</p>
<p>In most teams I’ve worked with (and I’ve worked with <em>many</em>
different teams of all shapes, sizes, and locations) it’s far more
common for everyone to swim in a different direction.</p>
<p>The result is that most effort is spent on correcting misalignment
and miscommunication than productive work. <em>Imagine how much more
productive your team will be if everyone was swimming in the same
direction.</em></p>
<h1 id="productivity²-goal-x-feedback-motivation²">Productivity² = goal
x feedback × motivation²</h1>
<p>The simplest definition of productivity is measuring the ratio of
<strong>inputs</strong> that is used in order to provide a useful and
desired <strong>output</strong> people will pay for. The fewer inputs
and the shorter the lifecycle to turn inputs into outputs, the more
productive you are, regardless of whether you’re measuring people
productivity in software development or building a car in a factory.</p>
<p>Focusing only on increasing speed and reducing variance is not
necessarily productive at all. You have a 50% chance of your effort
being productive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s impossible to be productive without a goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s only productive if you’re clear on the goal and confident that
it is a product or service users <em>actually</em> want and need. No
efficiency improvement alone is going to ensure that you’re working on
the right goal.</p>
<h2 id="without-a-goal-you-cant-be-productive">Without a goal you can’t
be productive</h2>
<p>To maximize your productivity, clarify your goal and build in
meaningful feedback loops that is both scientific and meaningful to the
customers.</p>
<p>Measuring analytics, for example, is useful to test what is already
created, but it is more useful to speak to a select few customers to
uncover what’s missing when you’re building a new product or
service.</p>
<p>It’s not the one or the other, it’s about understanding what you want
to learn and finding the best way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-is-more-important-than-outputs">Feedback is more
important than outputs</h2>
<p>The faster you can learn and improve, the more productive you
are.</p>
<p>Without feedback loops you are not learning at all. It’s better to
speak to a handful of key target users early in the process than to get
1, 000 users using your product after it’s fully build, just to discard
it after a day or two. It’s about getting it right early on, not getting
it perfect once off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfection is a waste. Feedback is value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-missing-and-most-important-key-to-productivity">The missing
(and most important) key to productivity</h2>
<p>Although you might have a goal and short feedback loops, by far the
most crucial key to productivity in a knowledge work environment is
human motivation.</p>
<p>A motivated human is eager to produce, make less errors, and
communicate better ultimately reducing errors and wasted effort. When an
employee is demotivated, on the other hand, they are bound to work
slower and make more mistakes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most productive teams work as well together as what they play
together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don’t already, invest time in discovering what motivates each
person in your team and what their individual strengths are. There is
little more motivating than allowing a person to use their strengths.
And make space for emotions. Life is full of emotional ups and downs and
it’s not possible for a human to always be in top form.</p>
<p>Sometimes life throws you a curve ball that’s hard to deal with. It’s
human to be distracted or simply demotivated at such times. Expecting
people to, like machines, always be on optimal productivity levels is
insane and far from realistic or achievable.</p>
<p><em>You can have the best tools and skills, but without strong
relationships and human-to-human connection you are as weak as the
weakest link in your team.</em></p>
<h2 id="are-you-measuring-the-right-thing">Are you measuring the right
thing?</h2>
<p>If you’re measuring speed, velocity, or number of outputs you have a
50/50 chance of being productive, even when there is an increase in
these measures.</p>
<p>Efficiency becomes useful when you produce the same artifact
repeatedly.<br />
In software development we mostly produce something that has never been
produced before. If you haven’t done it before, it’s pretty much
impossible (and mostly useless) to estimate. It’s only a guess. And
we’re not very good at guessing when it comes to time.</p>
<p>The key to productivity is thus getting clear on the desired outcome.
<em>Are you solving the right problem to begin with?</em> And do you
understand the problem and the underlying need? Or do you just think you
do? Without speaking to users and letting them use it in <em>their
contextual setting</em>, you can’t possibly be sure if you’re solving
the right problem.<br />
<br />
There are of course useful metrics such as measuring lead time (the time
it takes to release a single feature), the deployment frequency (how
often you release new features to production), and other DORA metrics.
But they all assume you are building the right thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you’re measuring the wrong thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="debunking-the-buts">Debunking the but’s …</h2>
<p>Most teams, when asked, will come up with a <em>but</em> — some sort
of excuse why they failed to deliver or be productive.</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t have enough people.</li>
<li>We need funding.</li>
<li>We don’t have the best tools.</li>
<li>We need more time.</li>
<li>It’s complicated…</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these <em>but’s</em> are valid or true. Resources are rarely,
if ever, the cause of productivity issues.</p>
<p><strong><em>You don’t need more time.</em></strong> You need to
improve what you do with your available time and how you <em>spend</em>
what you have. Are you jumping in and solving a problem you think you
know the answer to? Or are you doing fieldwork to discover the
underlying needs?</p>
<p><strong><em>You don’t need more people</em></strong> (in most cases).
Adding more people, as in a typical manufacturing environment,
introduces unnecessary complexity that slows down rather than speed up
production. More people simply means a higher probability that some will
be swimming upstream, while others are swimming downstream.</p>
<p><strong><em>You don’t need funding.</em></strong> Funding is a tool
for expansion and growth and there’s a handful of companies that rely on
adequate funding in order to be successful. Uber, for example, needed a
certain amount of cars and drivers in order to gain traction. Most
companies, however, don’t need that. If you’re working on 99% of
software products, you don’t need funding.</p>
<p>All funding will do is put more pressure on keeping shareholders
happy, naturally increasing the friction and increase complexity. If you
can’t make it work without funding, you’re probably don’t have feedback
loops or strong relationships. Or you don’t fully understand the problem
you’re trying to solve. If you know why you’re doing something or what
you’re trying to achieve, you can get feedback and learn using something
as simple as pen and paper.</p>
<p><strong><em>You don’t need better tools.</em></strong> Or any tools
for that matter. There is not a single tool on this planet that will
meet all your needs. They all have pro’s and con’s. There isn’t
something like the perfect tool. Never will be.</p>
<p>Most tools doesn’t even meet the needs of the creators in most cases,
as tools are by nature less adaptive and flexible than a whiteboard, a
conversation, or a pen and a piece of paper. Tools, in most cases, add a
level of complexity and administrative waste that decreases your
productivity.</p>
<p>If you strongly believe that you need better tools, I invite you to
take a deep look at yourself and why you think you need these tools. Is
it <em>really</em> to increase productivity? Or is it to manage and
control and know what’s going on all the time because you don’t trust
that the people will do the right thing?</p>
<p><strong><em>Your problem isn’t that complicated.</em></strong> You’re
making it complicated. Most probably because you haven’t spent enough
time iteratively understanding the user needs, finding patterns, and
doing architecture design upfront.</p>
<p><em>Apple become the world’s most loved brand for one thing and one
thing only. They simplified complexity and delivered less, but better
quality.</em></p>
<p>In the age of knowledge work adding more increases cognitive
overload<br />
which leads to slower decision making and higher probability of mistakes
and organizational waste in re-doing work as a result of these
mistakes.</p>
<p>If you think you’re product or service is complicated, it’s a symptom
of fragmentation in your organization and conflicting goals.</p>
<h1 id="productivity-for-humans">Productivity for humans</h1>
<p>Productivity for humans requires a clear goal and constant small
corrections to stay on track as best as possible. Like a GPS, it’s not
about staying on track all the time, but correcting your route early and
often, always having the end-goal in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To create hyper productive teams, you need clarity and alignment
towards a shared goal, regular and meaningful feedback loops, and the
ability express yourself fully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To maximize your productivity, you need to essential get more clarity
on your vision and goals, and strengthen your relationships. <strong>If
work doesn’t feel like play, you’re not being productive.</strong></p>

<h2 id="a-blueprint-for-creating-more-agile-organizations">A blueprint
for creating more agile organizations</h2>
<p><em>A practical book filled with case studies and how-to-guides to
transform large organizations into an agile startup culture, this book
is a valuable resource for executive leaders. A blend between Scrum,
Lean and the Lean Startup, this book brings clarity in how to bring
together these diverse and different methods into a winning recipe for
organizational mastery.</em></p>
<h1 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h1>
<p>The book is intended as a blueprint for executive leaders in large
digital organizations to implement a startup culture towards a more
agile organization.</p>
<p>It is also a useful guide for consultants and coaches wishing to help
large organizations with agile transformations with the tried and tested
approach to digital product delivery.</p>
<h1 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h1>
<p>It’s a well laid out book in two parts. The first part focuses on the
what while the second part outlines the how of implementing this
organizational blueprint. It is filled with success stories from actual
experience with the approach and easy to follow and read, making it very
useful.</p>
<p><img

<p>Image from <a href="https://www.organisationalmastery.com/"
class="uri">https://www.organisationalmastery.com/</a></p>
<p>The book starts off by explaining the key elements of the blueprint
as outlined in the book with the first element being the importance of
an organization wide vision or strategy that is understood and supported
by the entire organization rather than just the top executives.</p>
<p>The first chapter attempts to solve the problem so many large
organizations experience, namely how to translate strategy into daily
operations. It then moves on to the importance of organizational flow,
continuous improvement, knowledge sharing across teams and the
importance of innovation as part of an organization’s long-term growth
strategy.</p>
<p>The book manages to articulate concepts that sound somehow obvious,
yet, more often than not overlooked by large scale Scrum implementations
and large organizations in general, which tends to be fragmented. The
contents can be seen as the glue necessary to link operations to
strategy.</p>
<p>The key concepts different from other approaches which is worth
noting includes:</p>
<h2 id="product-vs-project">Product vs Project</h2>
<p>The first radically different approach to most organizations relates
to the organizational structure, with Luis arguing the need to have a
product, rather than a project focused structure. This approach is a
practical and easy-to-understand translation from the
<em>self-organizing team</em> concept from Scrum which is well-known but
badly understood with most organizations struggling with how to
practically make this shift in team structure.</p>
<h2 id="mini-startups">Mini startups</h2>
<p>The second shift from traditional approaches to product delivery is
to structure product teams as a mini startup rather than a functional
department. This builds onto the existing concept of Scrum’s
self-organizing teams, integration non-development functions and roles
into the team to literally have teams where each product is handles as a
mini startup.</p>
<p>Each team is responsible for all functions, including sales, human
resources and finance with each standalone team. The team has a budget
and is managed like venture capitalist would manage a startup. This
approach is in line with one of the fundamental differences between an
organization operating from a mainly orange paradigm and a teal paradigm
as described by Frederic Laloux in his book called <strong><em><a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/reinventing-organizations-a0babc967488">Reinventing
Organizations</a></em></strong> and is a nice expansion on the more
practical implementation of the concept.</p>
<h2 id="organization-wide-impediment-board">Organization-wide impediment
board</h2>
<p>The third and final noteworthy mention (although the book is filled
with other equally valuable concepts) is the concept of having an
organization-wide impediment board. Rather than each team improving in
isolation, Luis outlines the importance of having a transparent list of
organizational issues in the form of a public Kanban-type board with
organizational impediments.</p>
<p>These are only three concepts Luis explains in his book and the rest
is as useful and valuable, however, the purpose of this review is not to
summarise the entire book but highlight the main take-aways from my
perspective.</p>
<p>What I really like about the book is that it provides alternatives,
making it <strong><em>different</em></strong> from most books and
approaches which demands a single approach or recipe. Where Scrum, for
example, has a very strict and rigid recipe outlined, here each step
contains two options leaving you to decide which would be a better fit
for your organization, with both having the same outcome.</p>
<h1 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h1>
<p>The book is a very easy read that is well structured and filled with
case studies to strengthen the arguments. There are diagrams and
illustrations to further clarify concepts.</p>
<p>It is an accessible read that although focused on executive leaders
is a down-to-earth and easy to understand read useful to readers on all
levels of a large organization.</p>
<h1 id="i-like-i-wish-i-wonder">I like, I wish, I wonder…</h1>
<p>As I mentioned, <strong><em>I really like</em></strong> the
alternatives provided for each core element of the blueprint, depending
on your current organizational structure and needs, making it a much
easier implementation than not being presented with choice. I also
really like the tone and writing style and structure of the book which
is well laid out and easy to read.</p>
<p>I also like the case studies included, although <strong><em>I
wish</em></strong> it was on a more practical level with maybe more
focus on return on investment. One or two of the case studies did this
well, however, the majority was hard to relate to and didn’t really
explain the impact of change or how to measure the improvement.</p>
<p>The one thing <strong><em>I wonder</em></strong> about is how
impactful this book would be if written in the same conversational style
as <em>The Goal</em>. From my experience, the implementation issues are
rarely as a lack of access to concepts or tools but more about the
conversations in order to influence change.</p>

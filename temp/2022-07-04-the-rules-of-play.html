    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="a-look-at-the-prerequisites-for-productive-play">A look at the
prerequisites for productive play</h2>
<p>Play is how children learn. It’s possibly the greatest tool there
is.</p>
<p>Play is a tool to master a new skill. It’s a tool to develop social
skills like negotiation and teamwork. It’s a tool to innovate.</p>
<p>When children play, they subconsciously give their playmates
permission to make mistakes. Something mostly unheard of in a corporate
world where success is mostly judged by past successes with potential
and possibility often disregarded as there’s too much risk involved.
Allowing people to make mistakes is a too high risk for a professional
environment.</p>
<p>Yet, it is in the risk-taking that growth and success lies. The
skills provided by play — namely cultivating curiosity, learning, and
social skills — is in fact what most organizations look for and need to
stay ahead of their game.</p>
<h1 id="the-key-to-productivity"><strong>The key to
productivity</strong></h1>
<p>Allowing a team to play a game together will not suddenly transform a
disengaged team into a productive, happy workforce. Similarly, adding
points, badges and leader boards don’t motivate everyone. In fact,
points, badges, and leader boards are a minute selection of hundreds of
game mechanics available that is designed to motivate only approximately
3% of all player types.</p>
<p>Definitely not the <em>one</em> answer to life, the universe, and
everything.</p>
<p>In itself a game doesn’t transform work into play, just like dressing
up like a superhero doesn’t make you Superman. For play to be productive
there must be a few crucial things in place. Here are the most crucial
ones:</p>
<h2 id="safety-first">1. Safety first</h2>
<p>Your first, and possibly most important, goal as game master at work
is to establish team safety.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p>Team safety first.</p>
<p><strong>No safety. No play.</strong></p>
<p>When your objective is to control people or manipulate them to do
something they don’t want to do, don’t be surprised when they don’t buy
into the game. Before you even attempt to play, the team needs to trust
that you have their best interest at heart.</p>
<p>Only once you have gained the trust of your team can you engage in
play, with one of the most important prerequisites for play being the
ability to totally relax. If they don’t trust you, they won’t relax.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule # 1 — For people to have fun, they must be relaxed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Play is essentially permission to explore and create in a safe
environment where failure is not only acceptable but often even more
spectacular and fun than winning.</p>
<p><em>There’s no shame in failing as compared to real life.</em></p>
<p>Creating an environment where it is safe to fail invites people to
take risks. When people are willing to take risks, they are also more
likely to solve problems more creatively and innovate.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong></p>
<p>To destroy safety, punish people subtly when they don’t behave the
way you want them to behave or when they make a mistake. Don’t do it.
Also, don’t ever, ever, <em>ever</em> make promises you don’t intend to
keep. Finally, don’t use ambiguous words like <em>we</em> when you
really mean <em>you</em>. Be clear and concise with your vocabulary.
Don’t leave room for confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Do</strong></p>
<p>To create a safe environment to play, the leader needs to
<em>consistently</em> prove that it is safe for people to make mistakes.
Take a quick anonymous poll at your next retrospective to evaluate how
people perceive failure and how safe they feel to make mistakes.</p>
<p>As a leader, demonstrate imperfection and how to handle it. Let’s
face it. No one is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. It’s how you
own those mistakes that earn you the respect of your team. Admit your
mistakes and say “I’m sorry” when due.</p>
<p>Safety, however, requires authenticity. Safety is a subconscious
mechanic and relies more on intent than behavior. The words “I’m sorry”
means nothing if there is not a genuine intent behind it.</p>
<p><em>Don’t say it if you don’t mean it.</em></p>
<p>Once safety is established, it’s game on!</p>
<p><strong><em>Let’s play…</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="theres-no-such-thing-as-forced-fun">2. There’s no such thing as
forced fun</h2>
<p>This brings me to the second rule of productive play, namely that
it’s only fun when you, as the player, have a <em>choice</em>. There’s
an entire scientific research paper written on the topic of forced fun,
or rather, questioning fun in the presence of involuntary play. Long
story short, it is not possible to have fun when it is forced upon
anyone.</p>
<p>The second rule of play is that for play to be fun and productive it
must be voluntary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rule # 2 — For play to be productive it has to be
voluntary.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A player must be able to <em>choose</em> whether they want to engage
in play, without any repercussions whatsoever. When the Scrum Master
pulls out the Lego and says “Let’s play”, it is a forced activity with
no real choice to the players. When the team has to play planning poker,
there’s no fun in that. Merely calling it poker doesn’t transform it
into a game, just like dipping broccoli in chocolate sauce doesn’t hide
the fact that it’s a vegetable, not a sweet.</p>
<p>To gain any benefit from play or make it engaging and productive it
has to be voluntary.</p>
<p>As the game master, when inviting people to play <em>always</em>
include the <a
href="https://positivesharing.com/2004/03/the-law-of-two-feet/">law of
two feet</a> — whereby everyone is invited to leave whenever they feel
they are not contributing — <em>and mean it</em>.</p>
<p>If there is <em>any</em> repercussion to a person deciding not to
participate in play, however subtle, you, as the game master, have
broken the most essential rule of play.</p>
<p><strong><em>Game over.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="make-space-for-play">3. Make space for play</h2>
<p>While your primary goal as the game master is to create safety, your
secondary goal is to reduce the workload to make space for play, a
subject I am <em>very</em> passionate about. No one can have fun or
relax when they are over-worked or has a deadline looming over their
head.</p>
<p>To create space for play <em>first</em> reduce the workload and the
stress. Don’t even attempt to play when there’s a deadline looming. Play
is not going to take away the stress. Rather, it will possibly add to
the stress. Having a little bit of fun is not enough to reduce the pain
of the missed deadline.</p>
<p>The game master must first and foremost facilitate a team-wide
clutter-clearing of work, specifically <em>busy</em>-work. Is what
you’re doing really productive? Does it help you meet your objective? Or
are you doing it because everyone else does it?</p>
<p>De-cluttering the workspace may take weeks or even months. In some
cases years. Systematically work through each aspect of work and reduce
the load until only value-add work is left over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rule # 3 — Timing is everything. Make space for play.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the workload is manageable, clear out your calendar and respond
to playful gestures from the team.</p>
<p>You’ve got 30 seconds or less before the playfulness is gone. Use
it.</p>
<p><em>Play is an attitude.</em> It relies heavily on emotion. The good
ones. Especially initially while you’re still trying to get buy-in from
the team it’s crucial to have impromptu play-sessions rather than
scheduled play.</p>
<h2 id="co-create">4. Co-create</h2>
<p>In improv theatre one of the fundamental rules is that of
inclusivity. Each time someone comes up with a suggestion, the response
is acceptance and inclusion. <em>Yes and</em>, rather than no but. When
you don’t go <em>with</em> the story, you block it. The same applies for
play to be fun. It’s more fun when everyone is included.</p>
<p>The best play sessions happen unplanned and is <em>created</em>, not
planned in detail. Your role as game master is to create an environment
for play and <em>facilitate</em> the session, not control it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rule # 4 — You’ve succeeded when it’s their idea and everyone is
included.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most important aspects of fun is self-expression and
player autonomy. When play is owned by everyone, with each individual an
active co-creator, it’s <em>really</em> fun. When one person is
responsible for all the rules and how to play, it’s less fun.</p>
<p>As game master, you may start with a suggestion and some basic rules,
but always invite suggestions from the players. You know you’ve
succeeded when the players shape the game.</p>
<h2 id="start-small">5. Start small</h2>
<p>So many things never get done because it’s simply too big. Small is
beautiful.</p>
<p>Don’t spend months trying to design the <em>perfect</em> game.
There’s no such thing. Don’t try to be original or weird.
<em>Anything</em> can be turned into a game. Play is more an attitude
than a skill. Play relies heavily on imagination and movement.</p>
<p>Don’t <em>try</em> to play. Rather, let it happen organically and
evolve little by little. Apply one of the many game mechanics to your
retrospectives rather than trying to invent an entire new game.</p>
<p>For example, when you test a system, typically you need to create
test data. Make it more playful by substituting boring names like John
Doe, with your favorite Marvel characters.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget the first time I demo’ed a system to an unexpecting
and very serious group of highly educated people using users as
characters from the Fifth Element movie. Hidden giggles evoked from the
audience while I seriously pretended nothing was wrong as I continued
the demo. The giggles relaxed the audience and allowed for more open
interaction and knowledge sharing that previously was not ‘acceptable’.
By breaking the social rules just ever so slightly, I opened the door
for collaboration between different teams and soon competition turned
into comrades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule # 5 — Anything can be turned into play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Play is about the unexpected. It’s about imagination. Rather than
talking <em>about</em> the users, <em>become</em> the users. Immerse
yourself. Take on an imaginary persona and do and say things out of
character for you. <em>Pretend</em>. Just for a little while.</p>
<p>Don’t take work so seriously. Care less about what other people
think. You can’t have fun and worry about what other people think at the
same time. Choose wisely where you put your attention.</p>
<p>More fun games are usually simple and straight-forward without long
explanations. The game master’s goal is to add playful design to boring
or complex work as an <em>integrated</em> part of it, not a separate
game that doesn’t link back to the work in any way.</p>
<p><strong><em>The power of play lies in your ability to integrate it
back to the workplace.</em></strong></p>
<p>When, for example, you want people to be more vulnerable and connect,
play your version of truth and dare. When you want people to pay
attention, play a version of spin the bottle rather than the traditional
round-robin to decide who’s next. No need to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Your goal, as the game master, is to <strong><em>find the
fun</em></strong>. It’s when people are having to fun that they are
highly engaged, when they come up with ideas worth exploring when they
are more open to collaboration.</p>
<h1 id="find-the-fun">Find the fun</h1>
<p>Playful design is inclusive design. It’s a way to bring out the best
in everyone in the team. It’s about acceptance, and acceptance is the
highest currency to express love. When people feel loved, they’re
productive, they’re engaged and they’re committed.</p>
<p>And when everyone in the team feels safe to play, the <em>real</em>
work can begin.</p>

<p>So many methodologies, so little time.</p>
<p><em>Scrum. Agile. Lean. Lean Startup.</em></p>
<p>Which one is best for you? What is the difference? What are the
similarities?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions I see flying around the internet,
trying to make sense of the nuances between all these different
methodologies, or rather systems.</p>
<p>Confusing. To say the least.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to put all the pieces of the puzzles together
in a summarized version of <em>my</em> interpretation of the different
methodologies to help you decide which one is most suited to you.</p>
<p>So let’s jump right in. Hope you like gardening! As this is the best
metaphor I could think of to explain how I see it.</p>
<p>Below is an image of the evolution of a tree from seed to flourishing
tree to demonstrate when each methodology might be most useful, followed
by a bit more details on the specific similarities and differences.</p>
<h2 id="from-seed-to-seedling-the-lean-startup">From seed to seedling —
the Lean Startup</h2>
<p>All trees starts off as little seeds hidden under the ground where
no-one can see them.</p>
<p>An idea.</p>
<p>There is the <em>potential</em> to become something big and
beautiful, but it’s just a little seed. Google was once a big dream of
making information accessible to everyone. Apple was the dream of
ground-breaking technology innovation. AirBnB was the dream of
capitalizing on wasted space.</p>
<p>That’s when the <strong>Lean Startup</strong> is the most useful to
look at. It’s designed for entrepreneurs (may it be a founder of a new
business or merely a department within a bigger organization responsible
for R&amp;D) with the focus of nurturing an idea so that it becomes a
<em>thing</em>. A thing someone wants and is willing to pay for, also
called a Minimal Viable Product. Something that might attract investors
to become something bigger.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="from-seedling-to-tree-scrum">From seedling to tree — Scrum</h2>
<p>Although technically Scrum can be applied while you’re still busy
trying to create the right product fit for the market, or when the tree
is fully grown, for the sake of simplification, Scrum is most useful to
put some structure to an organization that will nurture it enough to
grow into a tree, after it has been proven viable.</p>
<p>It’s a framework designed to allow organizations to deliver value
faster, following a set recipe with some room for movement. The focus is
on incremental delivery, or breaking down the elephant into bite-sized
bits.</p>
<p>In essence, <em>it’s a management framework applying some of the lean
principles</em> for a specific application in software delivery.</p>
<h2 id="growing-the-tree-agile">Growing the tree — Agile</h2>
<p>Agile (more correctly called agile <em>software development</em> but
to keep it shorter I’ll break the rules a bit and also call it
<em>agile</em>) came after Scrum and can be seen as an evolution of
Scrum. It focuses on the <em>mindset</em> and <em>decision making</em>
rather than the technical framework and tools of Scrum.</p>
<p>It <strong><em>adds</em></strong> onto, or is an extension of, Scrum
rather than to be seen as something different or competing. For more on
my perspective on how Scrum and Agile differs, read <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/scrum-is-only-the-beginning-of-going-agile-2e984ac7f348">Why
Scrum is only the beginning of going Agile</a> and <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/why-scrum-doesnt-make-you-agile-33f89498c02a">Why
Scrum Doesn’t Make you Agile</a>.</p>
<p>Most agile implementations (I know of) starts with Scrum (because
it’s so easy), with Agile adding and changing the ingredients of the
recipe to personalize it to the individual needs of the organization.
For example, the Scrum board changes into a Kanban board, which is a
Lean tool. Or you start using methods to improve how the development is
done, borrowed probably from XP. Scrum is the process or framework, XP
and other agile practices the pieces filling in the framework.</p>
<p>Agile is not a methodology at all. Rather, it is a guideline that
will help the organization become more adaptable to changing
requirements, or more <em>agile</em>.</p>
<p>In my picture, I see it as the stage where the tree is growing
sustainably. A one-size-fits-all solution is no longer suitable and a
more custom approach is required.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-eco-system-lean-production-tps">Creating an
eco-system — Lean Production (TPS)</h2>
<p>Finally, Lean, or rather TPS (Toyota Production System), is the
oldest and most mature system. Everything in Scrum is designed around
Lean. Everything in agile follows Lean methods too. Yet, Lean is much
more than all these methodologies combined.</p>
<p><em>Where Lean Startup, Scrum and Agile are focusing on the
<strong>how</strong>, Lean Production starts with <strong>why</strong>.
Lean Production is a leadership system rather than a production system
(whether producing information artifacts, software, business services or
tangible products like cars).</em></p>
<p>The way I understand it (and I could be wrong) is that it is about
creating a sustainable eco-system rather than just growing the tree.
It’s saving the rain-forests compared to producing more and more trees
for short term profit. It’s about constantly finding equilibrium — both
inside the organization by leveling workload and problem solving, and
outside, striving constantly for flow by including partners and
suppliers in their methodologies to enable them to deliver more
sustainably.</p>
<p>Lean is often used to describe the processes used to produce goods,
however it works not because of these processes, but because of the
foundation of purpose and the development of people and partners.</p>
<p>Where Lean Startup, Scrum and Agile are concerned with the tree in
isolation, Lean Production (TPS) is concerned with the tree <em>in
relationship</em> with the environment surrounding it. It aims to
maintain the entire eco-system sustainably, often making short-term gain
sacrifices in support of it’s long-term view.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that’s the difference between these different
methodologies. However, this is looking at the tip of the iceberg. The
ice-cap only. So let’s drill down a little deeper by looking at the main
differences and similarities between Agile (which can be seen as both
Scrum and Agile for the purposes of this post) and Lean.</p>
<h1 id="a-short-history-of-everything">A short history of
everything</h1>
<h2 id="lean">Lean</h2>
<p>Also known as Lean Production or Lean Manufacturing and more
correctly known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), lean is a
philosophy rather than a methodology. It’s a set of tools, values and
methods with the sole purpose of optimizing the value chain. Quoting
Taiichi Ohno, the founder of TPS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All we are doing is looking at the time line from the moment the
customer gives us an order to the point when we collect the cash. And we
are reducing that time line by removing the non-value-added wastes.”
(Ohno, 1988)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lean, in it’s essence, is about doing more with less. Constantly.
Small innovations as a habit. Being as
<strong><em>efficient</em></strong> as possible with the resources
available, and doing as much as possible with as little resources
possible. Aptly named <em>lean</em>. <strong>Never</strong> at the cost
of short-term gains though. <strong>Always</strong> with sustainability
in mind.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lean thinking</em></strong>, however, is a leadership
style rather than a methodology. It’s not so much about the efficiency
of the system than about developing people who has a lean mindset and
can create and maintain a lean system. <em>It’s about creating problem
solvers</em> rather than solving problems using a set of tools and
techniques.</p>
<p>Lean originated in car manufacturing where the goal is to produce the
same, tangible objects as predictably and reliably as possible, which is
different from Agile which originated in software development, where the
goal is to produce mostly <em>intangible and</em> unique products
reliably and consistently.</p>
<h2
id="leadership-and-efficiency-vs-change-management-the-differences">Leadership
and Efficiency vs Change Management — The differences</h2>
<p>The main difference between Lean and Agile is that Lean originated in
response to a need to deliver exactly <em>the same things
consistently</em>, whereas Agile originated in response to the need to
<em>deliver something different every time</em> an order is placed and
the ability to manage changes in the requirements. Secondary, Lean
manufacturing has a cast-in-stone set of requirements when an order is
placed, whereas Agile is a co-creation that is ever-evolving.</p>
<p><strong><em>Same-same, but different</em></strong></p>
<p>Where lean manufacturing dealt with minimal changes to the production
line, thus giving them time to perfect the process to produce the same
tangible thing, agile is at its heart is a change management philosophy
that enables a team to deliver an ever-changing product on an ever
changing production line.</p>
<p>Agile is about delivering something new and unique every time,
something that has <em>never</em> been done before. Lean is about
delivering the same thing every time, <em>exactly</em> as it has been
done before.</p>
<p><em>However, that being said, it should be noted that Lean was
invented as a result of a need to deliver different cars on the same
production line, so it’s not entirely true that Lean doesn’t handle
constant changes and chemical engineering has as many variances as can
be seen in software, but in software development, the changes are so
much more and so much more complex, making it a worthy difference
between the two for the sake of understanding.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Lead as if you had no power</em></strong></p>
<p>At the heart of Lean thinking, or TPS, however, is not production,
but leadership. It’s not so much <em>what</em> is being done as
<em>how</em> it is done. Where in agile development the Scrum Master or
agile coach is often chosen as the most senior developer who is able to
give all the answers, Lean has a coaching rather than management style
to problem solving, where the leader never tells the employee exactly
how to fix a problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Agile, the coach is often the hero, in Lean, the leader is always
a guide, <strong>never</strong> the hero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lean leader humbly leads as if they had no power. Their role is
not to make decisions, but to make sure that the employees make the
right decisions. It is based on a follower and transformational
leadership style routed in respect.</p>
<p>The entire Lean philosophy is built around highly motivated people at
the center of the organization. The goal is to empower people
<em>and</em> suppliers. The entire value chain matters, not just your
team or your department.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest waste is wasting the time and effort of the people doing
the work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agile, although fast changing, is mainly seen as a software
development methodology, which is merely one part in the overall supply
chain. No to very little focus is put on leadership values as such,
whereas Lean is built entirely on a foundation of strong leadership
based on respect and organizational purpose.</p>
<p><strong><em>Local vs Distributed</em></strong></p>
<p>Another major difference between Agile and Lean is that Lean was
developed with the workforce mainly co-located in one place, where-as
Agile mostly assumes a workforce distributed across the globe and in
different time zones.</p>
<p>Where Lean empowers the workforce to stop the production line when
they see an error, in a software development environment using
Continuous Integration with teams distributed across the globe, it’s not
as simple, and it’s not as easy to do a Gemba walk virtually as
physically either. Or maybe, we just haven’t had enough time to figure
out how to do it yet.</p>
<p>Agile, thus, requires a way to <strong><em>handle</em></strong>
errors — as it is inevitable — where Lean mostly attempts to
<strong><em>avoid</em></strong> errors by building in quality.</p>
<h2 id="delivering-value-faster-the-similarities">Delivering value
faster — The similarities</h2>
<p>Both, however, is about delivering value faster. Lean Manufacturing
does this with a number of tools and techniques to systematically reduce
waste; Agile does this with shorter feedback loops to enable correction
between the vision and the actual product faster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Culture is king</em></strong></p>
<p>Both Lean and Agile are cultures rather than a set of methods.
Actually, all the methods were created as a result of the culture of
learning and improvement both have.</p>
<p>Lean, above everything else I dare say, is based on a culture of
respect and humility. Teamwork and people development are also ingrained
in the philosophy, while pragmatic learning by doing and seeing for
yourself are compulsory tools for problem solving. There is no ivory
tower where the manager asks for a report on a problem, they walk down
to the floor and fully understand first-hand what the problem is.</p>
<p>Agile, similarly, suggests that face-to-face communication is the
best form of communication and people are more important than process.
It is also a learning culture above everything else, with team work and
humility also necessary ingredients for success. Transparency is yet
another value similar in both cultures.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reduce waste</em></strong></p>
<p>Both reduce waste constantly. In Lean Manufacturing waste is often
easier to spot as there are tangible artifacts lying around whereas in
Agile, waste is often harder to spot. However, there are more
similarities than differences, it’s just that we haven’t classified the
wastes in Agile as in Lean.</p>
<p>Redundant code or badly written code is one example of waste within
Agile. A growing backlog of bugs (excess inventory) another, with the
necessity to resolve a bug in the first place yet another. Bad tools
often are the biggest cause of waste, as information is at the center of
software development.</p>
<p>The only difference is <em>how</em> the waste is dealt with. In Lean
Manufacturing, cleaning up and ordering parts is one way. In Agile, TDD
is a tool to reduce the need to rewrite code. However, both can be
applied in either methodology, just as Bonjour in French is exactly the
same as Good day in English. It might be said in different languages,
but the <em>meaning</em> remains the same.</p>
<p><strong><em>Visual management</em></strong></p>
<p>What you can see, you an fix. Both Lean and Agile use visual
management, visualizing work and workflow. The one with a Kanban Board,
the other with a Scrum board and sticky notes.</p>
<p>Both identify issues or different states visually as a way to provide
feedback to co-workers and managers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Autonomous teams</em></strong></p>
<p>Lean empowers its employees by giving them responsibility and
ownership to make decisions, including the ability to stop an entire
production line when they see a fault. The manager can never tell an
employee what the answer to a problem is or what to do, their role is to
help the employee discover the answer themselves.</p>
<p>Agile teams also have autonomous teams who report to each other,
rather than to a team lead. The team is given ownership of how to
perform the tasks at hand exactly the same as Lean does.</p>
<p><strong><em>Continuous improvement</em></strong></p>
<p>Both Lean and Agile follow the Deming P-D-C-A cycle. In Lean
Manufacturing a hypothesis is made (<strong>P</strong>lan), it is
<strong>D</strong>one and <strong>C</strong>hecked and finally work or
tools standardized or the plan changed (<strong>A</strong>ct) before
starting a new work cycle.</p>
<p>In Agile a sprint is <strong>P</strong>lanned, a timeboxed sprint run
(<strong>D</strong>o), a review presented where the work is either
accepted or rejected by the business (<strong>C</strong>heck), and a
retrospective held (<strong>A</strong>ct) to re-evaluate what worked and
what not to enable the team to be faster and better the next sprint.</p>
<p>The Lean Startup, a different methodology all-together, is also built
around this feedback cycle.</p>
<h2 id="lean-startup">Lean Startup</h2>
<p>The Lean Startup has received a lot of attention in the media and I
often see people confuse Lean Startup with Lean Manufacturing. I’m no
specialist on the Lean Startup but I do know it solves different
problems than Agile and Lean and is mostly intended for a different
audience and a different phase of the product life cycle.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Y5iXybaQhcMYkfNMPGwvEw.png" /></p>
<p>Product Life Cycle</p>
<p>Lean Startup is a methodology aiming to help entrepreneurs make
better decisions while building a new business. It’s a tool set designed
to use validated learning in <strong><em>extreme</em></strong> unknown
environments. An entrepreneur is trying to figure out what customers
want, they are still <strong><em>defining</em></strong> the value chain.
Only once there is a product that has been sold at least a few times
does it make sense to <strong><em>optimize</em></strong> the process of
delivery using Lean and Agile principles. It’s thus most useful during
the discovery and introductory phase of a new product or service into
the market, when a value chain has not yet been formalized as a
repeatable process.</p>
<p>Scrum, as mentioned before, is a useful starting point towards agile
and ultimately Lean. It can be implemented at any phase actually,
however, it is (in my opinion) most useful when embarking on an agile
transformation. Every agile transformation I’ve witness, has outgrown
Scrum at some stage and moved more towards Lean, with Agile the bridge
between Scrum and Lean.</p>
<p>Lean Manufacturing and Agile are very comparable, both focused on
delivering value faster while the product is growing, and actually,
focused on maintaining growth. Toyota, for example, has been around
since the early 1900’s, with the parent company (and central player)
started in 1926 and is still a successful company nearly a century
later.</p>
<h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h1>
<p>Agile and Lean have more similarities than differences, and in my
opinion, Agile is moving more and more towards becoming an industry
specific implementation of Lean. Agile adds some useful concepts to the
traditional Lean Manufacturing toolset, of which the introduction of a
more gamified environment is one huge benefit that I haven’t seen in
Lean. Another major benefit is the accessibility to implementation that
Agile brings with the inherent software based solutions it produces.</p>
<p>The software development community at its heart is a sharing
community, maybe due to the nature of the work, maybe due to the nature
of the people, but more than ever (maybe I just didn’t look hard
enough?) do I find resources and methods openly being shared that
enables more and more people to implement Lean and Agile principles in
their environment.</p>
<p>My prediction is that in the next 5 years Agile and Lean will be used
intermittently as the same thing, as integration between different
departments, industries and technologies become more standard.</p>

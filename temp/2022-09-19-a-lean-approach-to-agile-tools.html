    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="you-dont-need-tools-to-be-agile">You Don’t Need Tools to be
Agile</h2>
<p>In the kitchen, tools are essential for preparing a meal that doesn’t
only taste good, but looks great. A sushi chef uses only the best
knives. A cake in the right baking tin bakes perfectly. Smoothies can
only be made with a blender, and mixing spices are so much easier with a
mortal and pestle.</p>
<p>Tools are awesome. There’s no denying that. Sometimes it’s simply not
possible to create a great meal <em>without</em> the right tools. The
same is true in the software development industry. We need tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People working in the software development industry, more than anyone
else, love tools and technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it doesn’t excite you to see the power of technology and what can
be done with it, you’re in the wrong industry.</p>
<h2 id="lean-tools-are-agile-but-agile-tools-arent-always-lean">Lean
tools are agile, but agile tools aren’t always lean</h2>
<p><em>But just because you can automate it, doesn’t mean you should.
I’ve seen more examples of how tools inhibit team progress than what it
enables them.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Form follows function. Tools follow process.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what if your processes are always evolving, as indeed it should
if you call yourself agile? Can and should you have any technology
driving the process? Should you use an electronic whiteboard? Is it
really more productive to automate the daily stand-up?</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with tool overload, ask yourself this one
question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Are individuals and interactions more important than processes
and tools?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, re-evaluate whether you <em>really</em> do need
the tool. Chances are that interactions between individuals are being
impeded by the tools, making you <em>less</em> agile.</p>
<p>Automating the daily stand-up? <em>Always</em> a bad idea. Using an
electronic white board? Mostly a bad idea unless it’s a remote team and
it’s impossible to get everyone together. A workflow management tool?
Sometimes helpful, sometimes not.</p>
<p>Not convinced?</p>
<p>The very successful teams at <strong><a
href="https://crisp.se/">Crisp</a>,</strong> and my favorite source of
agile resources, manages to run complex projects relying on physical
Kanban boards rather than tools, as they’ve documented in <a
href="https://www.crisp.se/file-uploads/Lean-from-the-trenches.pdf">a
book based on an actual project</a>, so why wouldn’t you too?</p>
<p>Lean and agile both are about <em>visualizing</em> work and adapting
to <em>change</em> incrementally. The tools don’t have to include
technology, they are merely <em>standardized systems</em> allowing teams
to be more productive. Continuous adaptation and change, or
<strong><em>kaizen</em></strong>, are valued more than stable, or rather
stagnant, processes.</p>
<p>Lean tools don’t have to involve any technology. The example posted
by <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnakamuro/">Jun
Nakamuro</a></strong> on his LinkedIn profile below shows how the
service industry in Japan uses lean to manage the cleaning of hotel
rooms using color coded magnets — a perfect sample of an effective tool
without any technology.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*lsmYT6YQY15tHnsezgcxaQ.png" /></p>
<p>Image obtained from Jun Nakamuro’s LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>If everyone doesn’t follow the system, however, it falls flat.
<strong><em>The tools and systems are only as good as the people using
them.</em></strong> It’s not the tools or systems that make you agile,
it’s the teamwork and collaboration that dictates the success of the
system.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-tools-vs.-the-nature-of-agile">The purpose of
tools vs. the nature of agile</h2>
<p><em>The only reason for having a tool is to make your life
easier.</em> It’s that simple.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t save you time and help you be more productive, it’s an
impediment, not a tool.</p>
<p>Tools should help you do your work <em>faster</em>. They should help
you make better <em>decisions</em>. The should <em>save</em> you time,
and <em>improve</em> your collaboration. By doing the hard or boring
work, they should <em>free you up to be creative</em> and come up with
awesome solutions<em>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your tools don’t improve collaboration, consider getting rid of
them. It’s not the tools that make a company agile, it’s choosing the
right tools for the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>More than anything else, for a team to be agile, they need to work
together as a coherent team. Each person has to speak as if from the
same voice.</p>
<p>Jira doesn’t mean that you’re agile. Using Trello doesn’t mean you
have a smooth workflow process. Using Slack doesn’t mean that your team
is collaborating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No tool in the world is going to make you agile when there is not a
functional team driving it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, the most agile decision you can make is to get rid of the
“agile” tools and focus on the relationships first. <em>People matter
more than tools.</em></p>

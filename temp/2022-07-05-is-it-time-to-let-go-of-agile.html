<h2 id="a-critical-look-at-the-difference-between-waterfall-and-agile">A
critical look at the difference between waterfall and agile</h2>
<p>In a talk called “<strong>Agile is Dead”</strong> by one of the
founding members who created the manifesto for agile software
development, he claims we should scrap the word agile from our
vocabulary (especially when used in the proper noun capitalized A form
as in God). He claims that the word “agile” is an adjective, not a verb
or a noun.</p>
<p>For the full talk, see the video below:</p>
<p><a

is Dead * Pragmatic Dave Thomas * GOTO 2015</a></p>
<p>I tend to agree with his sentiments.</p>
<p>The problem it creates is that everyone calls themselves agile, even
though decision making might take month or even years (as is typical in
a large corporate and can’t exactly be described as agile, maybe just
more agile than before?).</p>
<p><em>The true value of the work loses its lure because it is overused
and exaggerated.</em></p>
<h1 id="keeping-up-with-the-jones">Keeping up with the Jones</h1>
<p>The word “agile” tends to cause more confusion than clarity. The
mainstream success of Scrum has made this confusion even worse, with the
buzzword used abundantly to describe anything that <em>someone</em>
deems to be (even just slightly) “<em>better</em>” than the proverbial
Jones’ next door.</p>
<p>When you want to sell your service or product, you add “agile” or
“Scrum” in the proposal and wha-la! you win the contract because your
competitor didn’t. As if using a word is going to result in changes
within your teams to make you more agile in delivery…</p>
<p>Or, when you are looking for talent as a recruiter you add “agile” or
Scrum Certified as a requirement and wham! Your job spec sounds more
enticing to talent than the one without these buzzwords.</p>
<p>Yet, I see so many companies and people <em>say</em> they’re “agile”
because they changed their vocabulary but not any behaviors. A progress
report is now called a sprint, even though there is no <em>potential
shippable product</em> ready at the end of the interval. There has only
been progress. Sometimes not much. Sometimes even in the wrong
direction.</p>
<p>They have daily slack-bot stand-ups (“because slack is so cool and
everyone agile uses it!”), or they use a more agile workflow tool (the
typical <em>“we-use-Jira, so-we-are-agile”</em> syndrome). Yet, fail to
understand why communication isn’t better or why work doesn’t flow
better as agility promises.</p>
<p>It drives me insane.</p>
<p>And raises a big question. <em>If Scrum is a process framework and a
certified Scrum Master can help implement the process, why is it that it
is not working?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curiosity, I mean simplicity, killed the cat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the core strength of the Scrum framework is also the reason
for its downfall. Scrum is marketed as a simple and lightweight
<em>process</em> framework. Getting certified is as simple and
lightweight though, requiring merely a 2 day training course and written
exam, making it extremely accessible. <em>Too</em> accessible in my
opinion.</p>
<p>The process is however not what makes you more agile. It merely
allows you to uncover your failures faster. If you refuse to look at
these and change your behaviours, tools, and processes, your merely
moving the dirt around without actually cleaning anything. It’s like
mopping a dirty room without throwing out the dirty water.</p>
<p>Or, it’s like expecting to get a chocolate cake without changing the
ingredients you used to bake bread. The process is important, but the
ingredients are key. No cocoa, no chocolate cake. Period.</p>
<p>The main ingredient to achieve agility is mindset and team
dynamics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindset beats process every time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news is that mindset results in behaviours, and behaviours
can be observed. And changed.</p>
<p><em>If you know what to look for…</em></p>
<h1 id="vision">2020 vision</h1>
<p>So what do you look for to evaluate the level of agility? And what
does a truly agile team look like? And should we be calling
“<em>it</em>” agile in the first place?</p>
<p>I do believe ‘agile’ is a good, descriptive word. I don’t, however,
think it sufficiently describes what exactly it entails and creates a
misconception that it’s all fun and games. There is not enough emphasis
placed on the need to slow down and carefully look at the monsters under
the bed on the journey towards agility.</p>
<p>However, semantics aside, let’s leave the philosophical debate and
rather look at what we <em>can</em> do.</p>
<p>To begin with, critically, and honestly, evaluate the true agility of
your team or organization by looking at some of the most common
behaviors (or rather mis-behaviors) and patterns.</p>
<p>It is by no means a comprehensive list but should give you a good
idea of where you’re going wrong and what to do about it if you do.</p>
<h2 id="communication-style">1. Communication style</h2>
<p>One of the most important things to look for is the main
communication style within the organization.</p>
<p>In a waterfall, or less agile approach, communication is typically
top-down. In group meetings (including the stand-up) the team tends to
look at and report to the manager, team lead or Scrum Master. They also
tend to refrain from raising issues, obediently performing tasks
assigned to them by the team lead.</p>
<p>Contrary, in a more agile approach to business communication is
driven mostly bottom-up. The <em>team</em> has the ultimate decision
making power, not the manager. <em>They</em> say what work they will do
and how long they need and they’re not afraid to speak up when they see
a dysfunction or issue. <em>They question everything.</em> In an agile
team setting, people tend to report to and look at <em>each other</em>
rather than the leader.</p>
<h2 id="communication-channel">2. Communication channel</h2>
<p>Possibly even more important than <em>who</em> people communicate to
is <em>how</em> they choose to communicate.</p>
<p>In a more waterfall approach communication tends to be in one
direction with one person (usually the manager) speaking mostly
<strong><em>at</em></strong> the team, softening harshness and avoiding
conflict. Technology as an enabler for this type of communication means
mostly digital communication is preferred. Slack conversations or
comments in workflow tools like Jira or Trello is commonly substituted
for group meetings to talk about things in person. Digital is also
preferred for bearing bad news.</p>
<p>Remote work is preferable for teams who want to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>In a more agile approach the communication is honest and
bi-directional with face-to-face interactions preferred. The tool is
never more important than the person and is used when something needs to
be remembered or tracked, <em>supporting</em> face-to-face
communication, not controlling it. People sit together and frequently
chat. They don’t wait for a meeting or any other form of permission to
initiate a conversation. The Scrum Master or Agile Coach facilitates and
enables conversations rather than lead it.</p>
<p>Remote work sucks. Or when they’re remote, they like showing their
face on video calls and chat with each other even when they don’t have
to.</p>
<h2 id="task-assignment">3. Task assignment</h2>
<p>A key behavior in a team that directly measures the level of
responsibility (and thus agility) within a team can be observed with how
tasks or work is assigned.</p>
<p>In a waterfall driven environment work is assigned to specific team
members in a top-down approach by the manager, whereas an agile
environment allows the team to pull (rather than push) work when they
have capacity and when they feel competent to achieve the task at
hand.</p>
<p>The manager may at times assign specific challenges, but mostly
create an environment where each person has adequate opportunity to
excel by ensuring there is a wide variety of tasks that will satisfy and
challenge each person in the team, without pushing them beyond their
boundaries.</p>
<p>For example, when someone seems overwhelmed, ensure there is adequate
smaller tasks that can more easily be achieved. Or, when a talented
resource seems bored, ask them to find a solution to a particular
problem that gives them freedom to showcase their strengths and
interests.</p>
<p>When no-one wants to pick a task, uncover the reason why and resolve
that rather than force them to do it.</p>
<h2 id="decision-making">4. Decision making</h2>
<p>Another key indicator of agility is the decision making process and
style of an organization. The faster you can make (good and sustainable)
decisions, the higher your level of agility.</p>
<p>In a less agile organization the boss is the ultimate decision maker
and decisions are usually made in isolation with little to no input from
the team. In a beginner agile team often rash decisions are made, which
may seem fast in the short run, but soon need to be re-looked at.</p>
<p>Contrary, in an agile environment the team is the ultimate decision
maker with decisions made collaboratively and slowly, with
implementation fast.</p>
<p>People are assigned specific levels of authority that empowers them
to act without always asking for permission first. When there is
uncertainty, the team leader (or someone other that is seen as key) is
asked and advice given in a coaching style rather than a directive
style. The role of the team manager is to help the team make the right
decisions, not to give them the answers to all the decisions.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-mistakes-and-failures">5. Dealing with mistakes and
failures</h2>
<p>When a team is empowered to make decisions, it also means there needs
to be room for failure. In an agile environment mistakes are owned and
corrective and preventative action implemented to prevent it from
happening in the future to minimize the risk and impact of the
error.</p>
<p>In a non-agile environment mistakes are not acceptable and as a
result is often hidden until it’s too late to resolve without pain or
high cost.</p>
<p>Agile teams are all about transparency and responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-tools">6. Choice of tools</h2>
<p><em>“We use Jira and Slack at work, so we’re agile”.</em></p>
<p>Personally, I don’t understand how this even became a thing in an
agile community. Equating your level of agility in terms of which tools
you use (to me) is insanity.</p>
<p>Changing a tool, compared to hand written, is slower, more expensive
and much more limited in the amount of options it can manage at a
specific time. And the tool is only as good as the information it holds.
Garbage in. Garbage out.</p>
<p>It’s not the tool that matters, but how people use it. Closely look
at the content of the tool to discover the <em>actual</em> behavioral
patterns of the team.</p>
<p>On the other hand, wiping out something on a white board, adding
another step to a workflow, or moving tasks around is fast, effective
and most of all, tactile, which means more engaging.</p>
<p>The level of agility can be rated pretty accurately at a glance by
the amount of visual artefacts and the frequency it changes. Too pretty
and laminated and part of the furniture? Probably not very agile. Hand
drawn, worn out and scribbled on? Probably more agile.</p>
<p>Another behavior to look for is the level of active interaction with
these artefacts. In a less agile team the team passively observes from a
distance whereas in a more agile team they own the artefacts on the wall
and use it.</p>
<h2 id="talker-or-do-er">7. Talker or do-er?</h2>
<p>Probably the easiest behavior that is an indication of an
organization’s agility is the amount of talking that goes on. If the
team can’t keep to a 15 minute stand-up time limit, start looking at why
and raise the false agility flag.</p>
<p>Is it because one person is talking too much? False alarm. Is it
because people are giving reasons and explanations and defending
themselves because they didn’t achieve their goals? Jackpot.</p>
<p>A non-agile team often consists out of talkers who talk around issues
and want to create the perception of being busy.</p>
<p>An agile team, on the other hand, prioritizes action. Rather than
talking about something ,they will go and do it and show, rather than
tell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Actions speak louder than words.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="feedback">8. Feedback</h2>
<p>At the heart of agile is shorter (and more honest) feedback loops.
The entire Scrum model is based on the continuous improvement P-D-C-A
cycle where feedback is the essential tool to consistently and
continuously aim to shorten the gap between where you are and where you
want to be.</p>
<p>In a less agile organization, feedback loops are long, with yearly or
quarterly formal performance reviews. Typically, the manager waits until
the performance review to give feedback and feedback. Also typical is
waiting for everything to be complete and ‘perfect’ before you
start.</p>
<p>Agility is essentially about feedback and looking through the lens of
learning and curiosity.</p>
<p>In an agile organization feedback loops are short and results in
immediate action. There are frequent, small conversations throughout the
day (in person, Slack doesn’t count). There are at least daily check-ins
with the entire team and conversations happen in real-time.</p>
<p>See an issue? Raise it. Now.</p>
<p>See a desired behavior? Praise it. Now.</p>
<p>Don’t wait.</p>
<h2 id="team-structure">8. Team structure</h2>
<p>A less agile team consists of a bunch of people sitting in the same
physical location and working on the same project, but little to no
interaction between the different parts. Essentially, it is one-person
teams sharing a physical space. They are usually grouped per functional
area (designers together, testers together, programmers together
etc.)</p>
<p>An agile team is more autonomous and collaborative. There’s often a
healthy buzz as people pair, chat and help each other solve problems.
<em>Even if they’re working remotely, they always include others in
important decisions.</em></p>
<p>Everyone is involved in the decision making and each team has all the
skills needed to achieve the sprint goal. Each person in the team has a
unique superpower, with people knowing each other’s strengths and
weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="handling-constraints">9. Handling constraints</h2>
<p>A core principle of agile software development as stated in the
manifesto is responding to change over following a plan. A key question
to evaluate your agility is:</p>
<p><em>How does your organization handle unplanned events or
feedback?</em></p>
<p>An agile team responds to change and adapt fluidly and easily. A
non-agile struggles with change and tends to come to a grinding halt and
wait for everything to get back on track before they continue the
planned work.</p>
<p>A typical behaviour in a non-agile team is to respond to changing
requirements with resistance. A more agile team welcomes it with a
gamer’s mind.</p>
<p><em>An agile team looks for solutions. A less agile team complains
about obstacles.</em></p>
<h2 id="leadership-style">10. Leadership style</h2>
<p>Agility demands a more coaching style of leadership with the leader
serving as a facilitator rather than the oracle with all the answers.
<em>Humility is key to agile leadership.</em></p>
<p>In non-agile organizations the leadership (or rather management)
style is mostly more autocratic with the leader feeling threatened when
the team knows the answers to problems or can function without being
managed.</p>
<p>The more agile style of leadership is typically predominantly
servant-leader or transformational in nature, with trust and respect at
the core of the relationship between leader and follower. The
predominant leadership style in a less agile environment is more
autocratic in style.</p>
<p>The goal of a more agile leader is to enable and grow their most
valuable resource — namely the people who work for him. The goal of a
less agile leader is growth at any cost, often at the expense of the
people.</p>
<p>An easy behavior to for is observing how issues are handled. Do the
leader respond with the answer or recommend an action? Or do they
respond by asking a question?</p>
<p>Another behavior to look for is observing how impediments are
handled. An agile leader doesn’t mind getting their hands dirty and does
what is necessary to solve a problem. A less agile leader tells other
people to do the dirty work.</p>
<h1 id="time-for-teal">Time for teal?</h1>
<p>Looking at this list of behaviors, the process framework of Scrum and
the list of techniques associated with agile, it’s clear that agility
doesn’t have anything to do with the industry you’re working in or what
process model or tools you use.</p>
<p>What matters is culture. And leadership.</p>
<p>Both, which has been around for much longer than the word “agile” or
Scrum. Toyota, who is one of the key influencers who helped shaped
Scrum, was more agile then than many companies running Scrum now.</p>
<p><em>So is agile dead?</em></p>
<p>Is it time to let go?</p>
<p>Personally, I would vote with a definite “yes”, and with a tear in my
eye as it is close to my heart. Luckily endings are merely there to make
space for a new beginning.</p>
<p>And that new beginning still needs a name, but it’s already here in
the form of “<a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/a-teal-manifesto-68347d90957">teal</a>”.
“Teal” being as wrong as the world “agile” grammatically, but refers to
whole organizations seen as living organisms whereas Scrum was born
viewing organizations as a machine.</p>

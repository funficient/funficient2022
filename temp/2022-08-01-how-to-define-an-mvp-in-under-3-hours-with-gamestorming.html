combining Lean Startup &amp; Gamestorming</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What happens when you throw together a bunch of strangers with
only one thing in common — a desire to start a profitable
business?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*g3qXjwnagHIRMvE_PPXgjw.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This was the question we asked ourselves when we planned an
experimental gamestorming workshop. Our goal was to change the world of
entrepreneurship from a on-man-band into a social collaboration, tapping
into the collective ideas of a number of diverse skills and
experience.</p>
<p>Using Lean Startup as framework a half-day #gamestorming workshop was
planned to determine firstly what we all have in common and secondly to
come up with a testable concept that we can potentially turn into a
profitable business.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-lean-startup"><em>“What is the Lean
Startup?”</em></h2>
<p>The Lean Startup is all about fast failure, or the ability to adapt a
product or service as fast as possible based on actual data and
measurements rather than mere perception.</p>
<p>The goal of the workshop was to get just enough information to enable
a first validation of a new idea in the market. Basically, we wanted to
explore whether we have enough in common at all; and whether the
resulting idea is viable before investing any time in developing the
concept.</p>
<p>With no idea of what will come out of the session, a bunch of
strangers gathered, and here is a recap of our experience and the
lessons learned.</p>
<h1 id="collaborative-business-creation">Collaborative Business
Creation</h1>
<p>The workshop was broken into 5 parts aiming to answer a few questions
starting with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do we have in common?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="topic-generation">1. Topic Generation</h2>
<p>After connecting on a personal level over coffee and introductions we
started exploring what we had in common. Each person silently wrote
possible topics they are interested in on sticky notes and posted them
on the whiteboard with a brief explanation to the group.</p>
<p>The group was instructed to find someone else interested in a similar
topic and form pairs.</p>
<p>The <strong>first surprise</strong> of the day was that everyone was
mostly interested in one of the topics posted on the board, namely
developing a mentoring app suitable for social and group entrepreneurs.
Who would have imagined that a bunch of people with seemingly unrelated
professions all had one thing in common?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insight #1</strong> — While most people were influenced by
the previous person’s vote, looking for the similarities between them,
one person didn’t vote for any of the topics the other people posted,
even though he voted last and I expected that he would choose something
related. We tried to accommodate him by splitting the group to include
him.</p>
<p>He later proved not to be a team-player at all. In retrospect it
would have been better to leave him to develop his own concept (which he
thoroughly enjoyed) rather than trying to accommodate him to be part of
the bigger group.</p>
<p>Maybe inclusion is not about involving everyone?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="concept-generation">2. Concept Generation</h2>
<p>Using the <em><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/3-12-3-brainstorm/">3–12–3</a>
gamestorming</em> game the pairs immediately jumped into a first attempt
to come up with a rough concept of the chosen topic in under half an
hour. The ideas were presented and discussed, with the groups adding
critique and feedback.</p>
<p>We didn’t have time for a planned second round of ideation as the
group suggested we give immediate feedback on the ideas, so we continued
our discussion during the break over casual conversation and coffee,
refining our idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insight #2</strong> — Cross-team feedback so early in the
process turned out to be extremely valuable in developing the concept,
even though it meant there wasn’t enough time to refine the concept in a
second ideation iteration.</p>
<p>The conversation over coffee seemed to adequately shape the concept
into something more usable without needing to drill down into the
mechanics through a creative thinking exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Just enough is really just enough!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="market-analysis">3. Market Analysis</h2>
<p>The next question that popped up after we found common ground and
defined it to an acceptable level of detail was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who would use it? What does value look like for this audience?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the break we did a quick retrospective. True to my agile value
of <strong><em>responding to change over following a plan</em></strong>,
I adapted the plan based on the feedback from participants. We skipped
refining the product to come up with something more innovative and
unique and immediately jumped into market analysis based on this rough
outline of the concept.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Up7lcc96CriCbkjlGVGl5w.jpeg" /></p>
<p>On a grid each group mapped the potential users that might find such
a product valuable, using income and usage as parameters to find the
focus target market.</p>
<p>Each possible target group was mapped in one of the four quadrants
based on their income levels and the probability of how frequently they
would use the product.</p>
<p>The goal of the exercise was to identify a focus target market that
can be observed as first phase of a <em><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/bodystorming/">bodystorming</a></em> game
planned for a follow up session.</p>
<p>Interestingly, neither of the groups selected the primary target
market from the high income / high usage quadrant, which to me seemed to
be the logical starting point to validate whether an idea is feasible or
even wanted in the marketplace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insight #3</strong> —The trend for social entrepreneurship
business models more and more seems to focus on the end-users and main
consumers as driver rather than the people paying for the service and
making it feasible.</p>
<p>By focusing on solving a need for the majority of the users, who does
not necessarily have a lot of money to spend on the offering, value is
generated to high income users wanting access to the bigger market
share.</p>
<p>Both Google (providing a number of apps for free in return for the
information to use it for focused marketing) and LinkedIn’s business
models (providing the platform for free to job seekers gathering very
valuable information for recruiters who are willing to pay for this
information) proved that providing potentially free services and then
monetizing through a different channel can be more profitable than
focusing only on the main user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a primary target market in mind, we spent some time evaluating
the benefits and disadvantages using the <em><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/plusdelta/">plus/delta
gamestorming</a></em> game to identify what value might look like for
this target market. Each group offered further suggestions and critique
to the other groups to bring yet another perspective to the
ever-evolving concept.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-on-an-mvp">4. Deciding on an MVP</h2>
<p><em>With the primary target market and having a vague idea what would
be perceived as valuable for this audience we played a round of the <a
href="http://gamestorming.com/whole-product-game/">Whole Product</a>
gamestorming game to determine an MVP.</em></p>
<p>Each pair spent some time identifying the functions of the product
and then mapping them according to how necessary it should be in the
first iteration of a possible product.</p>
<p>The idea was to have a clearer understanding of what the product is
going to look at and what to look for when analysing and observing users
as part of the next phase of the experiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is our idea useful? Is it unique? Is it worth spending more time on
it? Does it have potential in the market place?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="user-validation-and-competitor-analysis">5. User Validation and
Competitor Analysis</h2>
<p>Each pair received homework, tasked to firstly do an initial
competitor analysis to see what other apps are already available, and
secondly to observe the chosen target market with the goal of testing
the concept against real users.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-takes-for-an-organization-to-become-agile">What it takes
for an organization to become agile</h2>
<p>H<strong>ell yes!</strong> <em>The answer, or rather my answer, to <a
href="https://medium.com/@nrgomes?source=post_header_lockup">Nuno Rafael
Gomes</a>’ question in his post “<a
href="https://medium.com/@nrgomes/organizational-agility-shall-we-dance-853b486c0191">Shall
we dance?</a>”, an essay using dancing the tango as metaphor to explain
how he views organizational agility compared to being agile.</em></p>
<p>He explains that organizational agility is not the same as agile.
Agile is something you can do alone. Organizational agility on the other
hand requires a whole team effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It takes two to tango.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further explains that organizational agility is about being able
and taking action on that ability. It’s about a dedicated practice
towards mastery. It’s about having the space and freedom to move around,
the direction and alignment to move together. It’s about trusting your
partner, and a balance between tension and fluency.</p>
<p>It’s an inspiring post filled with golden nuggets of wisdom, and here
is my response in an attempt to continue the dance, viewing it from the
perspective of how masculine and feminine works together to enable
organizational agility.</p>
<h2 id="its-all-about-relationships">It’s all about relationships</h2>
<p>You can be the best developer, the best UX designer, the best tester,
the best CEO, the best marketer. But being the best on your own means
nothing if there’s no-one to metaphorically dance with. Relationships
are at the heart of success. Whether it is at organizational agility or
marriage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s the age of the choir, not the solo performer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re trying to do it alone, or stand out, or be the best, or
always be the one that’s right, you’re not a team-player and lack trust.
Chance is that the people you work with don’t meet your expectations and
that means you as a team will never succeed.</p>
<p><em>Successful relationships can only happen when you know the
strengths and weaknesses of each party involved, is willing to engage in
occasional conflict <strong>with the purpose of restoring
harmony</strong> through understanding, and accepting each other
unconditionally. It requires a willingness to be vulnerable.</em></p>
<p>In a team setting, it means that each person needs to feel safe to
freely express themselves. It means that engaging in conflict is seen as
a tool for shared understanding, not punishment.</p>
<p>So with relationships at the heart of a team, what makes a team or
organization agile?</p>
<h2 id="organizational-agility-requires-passion">1. Organizational
agility requires passion</h2>
<p>The difference between an average and awesome tango is the passion
and spark between the two dancers. The difference between a good
relationship and a great one is also passion.</p>
<p>In an organization, passion is driven by the purpose of the company
and its alignment with that purpose. As Simon Sinek says, successful
companies start with <strong><em>why</em></strong>. And why is never
profit. Profit is the <strong><em>result</em></strong> of the why, not
the reason.</p>
<p>When you work for a salary or reaching a specific position, passion
is most likely not your driver. When people ask you what you do, you’re
most likely to respond by saying something that sounds like “I’m a
developer”. When, however, people ask you what you do and you respond
with something that might sounds like “I help more people have access to
sustainable energy”, there is purpose behind the statement. It’s still a
developer, but <em>what</em> does he develop? And why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where there is purpose, there is passion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To reach organizational agility, you need team members who are driven
by passion. You are as weak as your weakest link.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-agility-supports">2. Organizational agility
supports</h2>
<p>When a woman falls back sensually during the dance of tango, she
knows that her partner will catch her and support her. He won’t let her
fall. It’s this inherent trust between the couple that makes the dance
so beautiful.</p>
<p>To reach organizational agility, each team member needs to feel fully
supported. Pyramids simply don’t work. In a pyramid with the CEO on the
top and the worker bees at the bottom, everyone supports only one person
at the top, which is not a mutually beneficial relationship and thus not
sustainable.</p>
<p>A more supportive organizational structure is required where each
role is <em>equally supported and supportive</em>. For more about my
view on the leadership paradigm for the future, read my <a
href="http://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2017/07/05/a-leadership-model-for-the-next-paradigm/">post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-agility-aims-for-balance">3. Organizational
agility aims for balance</h2>
<p>The tango is such a exquisite art form because it is the perfect
union of two opposites — male and female. The male and the female that
engages in the dance is equally important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is not a winner and a loser, there is only a unified
couple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizational agility is no different, and it can only be achieved
when the entire organization as a whole, living organism, attempt to
find balance between the different elements.</p>
<p>Each team member should contribute something unique to the
organization. Copy-cat roles and functions simply don’t work. It’s about
understanding and appreciating the differences, not attempting to mold
everyone into what is seen as the “ideal” role-model for a specific
role. It’s about discovering each person’s “ideal” and allowing them to
fulfill that role within the company.</p>
<p>A man and a woman are very different beings. A man is strong, giving,
willful, forward, logical. A woman, however, is soft, receptive,
creative, forgiving, caring, nurturing, intuitive. When a woman is
expected to behave in a more male way in order to succeed in an
organization, the balance is thrown off.</p>
<p>In nature, when the balance is disrupted, some corrective action must
happen to restore the balance. Usually, it means floods, famine,
disasters, or disease. In organizations, it relates in volatility and
sometimes the dissolving of the organization as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To reach organizational agility, you need to find balance and harmony
between the different teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One team that is agile is not enough to make an organization agile.
Each team and business unit must be agile <strong><em>and</em></strong>
live in harmony with the other teams and business units in a supportive
whole.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Organizational agility is the mastery of a tango dance. It takes two
opposites coming together in a harmonious dance to make it
beautiful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Each part of the organization must support the other parts, be
driven by passion and always aim for harmony and balance.</em></p>

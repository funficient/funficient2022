    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="book-review">Book review</h2>
<p><em>A practical and essential toolkit for any entrepreneur, this book
contains practical advise to guide a small business owner’s funding
decisions. It is a comprehensive guide to help entrepreneurs understand
what funding options are available, and what investors are looking
for.</em></p>
<h1 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h1>
<p>The book is an essential addition to any entrepreneur setting out or
thinking of starting a new venture. It is an interesting, easy read for
anyone new to the funding world of small business, whether you are a
technology startup or a local restaurant looking to expand.</p>
<h1 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h1>
<p>The book literally contains everything that a new entrepreneur needs
to know about startup funding.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*uDBTFeDDEaFkbDh7jCfp8Q.png" /></p>
<p>It is filled with <strong>practical advice</strong> and <strong>case
studies</strong> from real people who managed to successfully secure
funding for their startup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s a practical book filled with answers to all your startup
funding questions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It covers all the important questions, like what funding
<em>options</em> are available, <em>when</em> to look for funding,
<em>what</em> you need in order to secure funding and even
<em>where</em> to find funding options and connect with possible
investors.</p>
<h2 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h2>
<p>It is an easy to read book written in a conversational style, written
from practical experience and personal success stories from a range of
different industries, including medical startups, technology- and
outdoor ski gear startups.</p>
<p>It contains a wealth of supporting diagrams and links to resources on
the web, making it a rich and interesting reading experience.</p>
<h1 id="i-like-i-wish-i-wonder">I like, I wish, I wonder…</h1>
<p>As a pragmatist, I simply loved the practicality of the advice and
the inclusion of real stories from real people. It starts with bursting
the bubble for anyone thinking startup funding is easy, pointing out
that all the success stories are written <em>after</em> the success,
which immediately drew me in. I wasn’t disappointed until the very
end.</p>
<p>Not ever having looked for funding myself and with an affinity of
working with startups, this was a much needed resource to help me as
advisor to entrepreneurs understand the challenges and needs of a
business looking for funding.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>variety of industries</em></strong> and case studies
were extremely helpful as from personal experience, I understand that
when it involves human beings, it’s much more complex than
one-size-fits-all answers to difficult questions. Having access to the
experiences of different people in different situations were extremely
insightful.</p>
<p>Each <strong><em>chapter follows logically on the next</em></strong>,
making the read easy to follow with questions being answered as they pop
up. The end of each chapter is summarized with the key take-away points
for the busy readers or more advanced investors.</p>
<p>The book doesn’t just tell you about the options available and how to
approach an investor, it <strong><em>helps the business owner
decide</em></strong> on a product mix and <strong><em>business
model</em></strong> that would not only be valuable to an investor, but
to the business owner himself. It certainly changed my mind on the
business model I had in mind. It is filled with business advice to help
entrepreneurs succeed.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking at funding or not, this is a very valuable
read.</p>
<p>The only <strong><em>criticism</em></strong> I could find is the
unfinished formatting with hard to read colors in certain sections. From
a content point of view, and as a new entrepreneur, there was no
question left unanswered in my mind after completing the book.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-author">About the author</h1>
<p><strong>Nicolaj Højer Nielsen</strong> is a startup funding expert,
who has secured finance for his own startups, as well as other’s, thus
the book is a collection of practical experience and real life successes
in the different funding arenas.</p>
<p>He is now a business angel himself, specializing in promising
technology startups, and love to help entrepreneurs succeed. He teaches
and coaches new entrepreneurs, truly passionate about entrepreneurship
and a specialist in the field.</p>
<p>His educational background includes studying Marketing and he has
earned an MBA.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The <strong><em><a href="https://startupfundingbook.com/">Startup
Funding Book</a></em></strong> is a essential resource for any
entrepreneur with not only practical advise on how and when to secure
funding for your business, but also how to structure your product
offering.</p>
<p>It is a comprehensive guide providing all the answers related to
sourcing and securing funding for a startup, with all that’s missing
from guaranteed success the actual idea and team. No entrepreneur who
has read this book has an excuse <em>not</em> to succeed.</p>

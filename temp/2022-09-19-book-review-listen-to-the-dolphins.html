    "description": "A practical guide to ensemble programming (mob programming), explaining why it works, how to get started, and how it improves quality, learning, and team relationships.",
    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

Bevan</h2>
<p><em>Set in the Firths around the Black Isle in Scotland, <a
href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0955249414/sr=1-1/qid=1486993577/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1486993577&amp;sr=1-1">Listen
to the Dolphins</a> is an easy, insightful and entertaining read about
organizational change. The easy to understand metaphors make this book
valuable to anyone interested in leading change in big organizations,
regardless of the industry, as there are no industry-specific buzzwords
or references.</em></p>
<h1 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h1>
<p>The story is told as a dialogue between Jess, a bright young girl,
and emerging change leader, and Flipper, a pod leader from a school of
dolphins who has witnessed many changes — from ancient battles to modern
industrialization as well as the despair left after the industry turned.
It contains valuable nuggets of wisdom as passed on through the
generations and draws on the wisdom of the collective history.</p>
<p>It highlights the importance of learning from the past while
balancing it and recognizing the need for new information and methods to
deal with our current and future issues.</p>
<p><em>Weaved in the story — perfect for a busy professional to double
as a bedtime story for their children — are lessons learned from
experience, making this book a practical toolkit for anyone new or well
versed in leading organizational change.</em></p>
<p>The humoristic writing style makes even the most serious and
sensitive topics a pleasure to read. Organizational politics and what is
usually considered the elephant in the room is tackled head-on, yet in a
light and fun way.</p>
<p>The message is reinforced by the different viewpoints, making it easy
to remember, while broadening the perspective. Each chapter is concluded
with a retrospective evaluating what Jess has learned during the day.
The method and writing style models the message, giving practical
examples in an objective environment.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-author">About the author</h1>
<p><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/clive-bevan-b2758223">Clive Bevan</a>
is an experienced change practitioner who has worked with more than
15,000 delegates with a wealth of information and wisdom to share on the
subject of change and leadership.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of concepts and strategies that worked from
his magnitude of past training and implementation programs and is based
on feedback from delegates and colleagues. Written from practical
experience, it’s a tried and tested recipe for success. It feels like
speaking to an elder when reading, filled with wisdom and nuggets of
gold on each page. The book is packed with all the answers imaginable
when it comes to organizational change by a trusted and down-to-earth
industry specialist.</p>
<p>It feels like speaking to an elder when reading, filled with wisdom
and nuggets of gold on each page. The book is packed with all the
answers imaginable when it comes to organizational change by a trusted
and down-to-earth industry specialist.</p>
<h1 id="the-contents">The contents</h1>
<p>Some of the topics and concepts include a detailed view on
communication within teams, politics that sabotage change — or as the
author calls it, the games that are played — a practical process for
change and the importance of team participation in the change process.
It continues to cover the need for trust when embarking on a change
process and the role of the leadership team.</p>
<p>It touches on the concept of a followership leadership style, where
self-organizing teams know when to lead and when to follow — a
ground-breaking topic which I would love to read more of. It breaks down
the hierarchies and silo’s and focuses on the success and safety of
everyone in the team.</p>
<p><em>In a nutshell, it is a comprehensive handbook of organizational
change, written in an easy-to-read and easy-to-remember practical
style.</em></p>
<h1 id="i-like-i-wish-i-wonder">I like, I wish, I wonder…</h1>
<p>What I liked best about the book is the tone of the message. It’s an
up-beat, fun book filled with humor, conveying a powerful message in an
easy read. A fresh alternative with as much substance than the more
serious and scientific academic reads.</p>
<p>Other than that, the practicality of the advice makes the book a
definite favorite for me, as my main interest is how to use knowledge.
Many books contain wonderful concepts, yet lack the practical tools of
how to implement this change. This book, on the other hand, focuses on
the practical side of change.</p>
<p>For the more scientific audience that is looking for a more serious
read, this is probably not the book for you. There are no references to
scientific research and studies, and is purely based on years of
practical experience and real-life success stories.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>A must read for anyone who is passionate about people and looking for
a practical toolkit on leadership and change to a future work
environment where each person is supported to fulfill their potential
and personal aspirations.</p>
<p>Perfect for busy professionals, the book doubles as time spent with
your children reading a bed-time story, while enhancing your own
personal skill set.</p>
<p>The book is available in hardcover on <a
href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0955249414/sr=1-1/qid=1486993577/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1486993577&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon</a>
and is planned to soon be released in electronic format.</p>

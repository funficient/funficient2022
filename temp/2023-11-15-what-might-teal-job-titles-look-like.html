<p>Orange organization there are cookie-cutter, standard job
descriptions for each role. These job descriptions are crafted based on
the organizational structure within a stable system. Changing these
solidified artefacts towards something more fluid and evolutionary is
hard. As part of the teal series, this post looks at how to handle teal
job titles and descriptions that reflect a teal way of operating.</p>
<p>Teal paradigms are known for equality and having a <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">non-hierarchical
structure</a>. They are also known for their adaptable, ever-changing
and fluid way of operating. Each project or iteration potentially will
need different roles and responsibilities. In the organization, this is
reflected by removing all job titles. Having everyone in the
organization with the same job title, however, can be challenging and
confusing. So how do you handle more fluid roles and maintain a level of
stability and structure?</p>
<p>It makes sense to go back to basics first to look at the intent and
purpose of job titles and job descriptions before redefining how teal
job titles might be handled.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-basics">Back to basics</h2>
<p>Just like street names and road signs are useful to navigate a new
city and keep roads safe from collisions, so too department names, job
titles, and other labels within an organization is useful to allow a new
person to navigate their way around.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of job titles is to enable people to find the
information they are looking for in an organization. Sometimes, for
example, you might need to know how to apply for leave, in which case
you will typically be directed to Human Resources. At other times, you
might need information on which software tools to use or obtain login
information, in which case you might be directed to the IT department.
Or, you might need information on the business rules for a specific
process, or maybe the architecture used, or who can help you test or fix
something. Job titles help you to find the information you need.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-job-titles">Benefits of job titles</h2>
<p>Don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Many organizations
operating from a ‘teal’ paradigm throw out all job titles with everyone
labelled associate or partner to reflect the flat hierarchy.  In
practice, however, this isn’t reflective of how the organization
operates. Everyone might be equal, but everyone is far from similar.  So
let’s look at the most important benefits that make teal job titles
useful.</p>
<h4 id="titles-can-streamline-information">1. Titles can streamline
information</h4>
<p>Just like naming the different organs and systems within a human body
allows you to make meaning of a complex system, so too job titles help
organize and make sense of a complex business system.  Titles help
streamline the flow of information – arguably the most valuable asset –
within an organization. It allows you to know how different people fit
into a bigger structure.</p>
<h4 id="titles-summarize-each-persons-strengths">2. Titles summarize
each person’s strengths</h4>
<p>Another benefit of a job title is that it tells you something about
the qualities and skills of a person. The title of “Project Manager”,
for example, typically implies good organizational and planning skills
and possibly a strong, decisive personality. The title of “Developer”,
on the other hand, implies an in-depth understanding of the architecture
and the system (or part thereof) and typically a logical, detailed way
of thinking.</p>
<h4 id="titles-communicate-skill-levels">3. Titles communicate skill
levels</h4>
<p>A third benefit of job titles is that it tells you the seniority and
skill level you can expect from different people. It would be unfair to
expect the same deliverables from a junior fresh out of school than from
an experienced employee who has worked on many different projects or has
superior skills in a specific area.</p>
<h3 id="the-shadow-side-of-titles">The shadow side of titles</h3>
<p>With these benefits in mind, let’s have a critical look at why job
titles can be harmful in an organization.</p>
<h4 id="titles-reinforce-hierarchy">1. Titles reinforce hierarchy</h4>
<p>The primary disadvantage of job titles, in my opinion, isn’t so much
the allocation of titles but that it reinforces a hierarchy. It’s seen
as a status symbol. People equate someone’s worth to the job title they
hold.  In many cultures, people tend to define their core identity with
their job.</p>
<p>Having a vertical career path and moving up the ladder to gain more
decision-making power implies that the only way to have a voice in the
organization is to become more senior. The consequence is that managers
and executives are often seen as more important than the people on the
ground, which I think is very inaccurate.</p>
<p>A business needs both juniors and seniors to succeed.  Just like a
talented chef able to create the most delicious food is not more
important in the overall restaurant system than the person serving it to
the guest, or even the person making sure the bathrooms are sparkling
clean, so to each person in an organization contributes something of
value to the overall success of the organization.   Job titles tend to
make some people more important than others which can be harmful.</p>
<h4 id="titles-encourage-competition-and-create-silos">2. Titles
encourage competition and create silos</h4>
<p>Another shadow of job titles is that it encourages competition within
the workplace. This creates a silo which in turn can create information
blockages. Most people are familiar with the consequences of silos in an
organization.</p>
<p>Although titles are not the single cause of this competition, it is a
very big part of it in most companies.</p>
<h4 id="titles-tend-to-fit-round-pegs-into-square-holes">3. Titles tend
to fit round pegs into square holes</h4>
<p>Each person is unique, like a fingerprint. Having specific job
titles, and particularly rigidly defined job descriptions, tend to fit
people into a particular box. This limits <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/01/18/major-mental-hurdles/">personal
growth</a> and the ability for someone to express their excellence to a
large degree.</p>
<p>One person, for example, might be a Product Owner who loves doing
customer support. They are strong on the details but maybe lack product
vision. Another Product Owner, however, might be strong on vision and
find needing to be responsible for customer supports limits her to look
at trends and overall patterns. Defining what and how a person can
contribute to a system is like fitting round pegs into square holes. It
doesn’t work well.  To get the most out of your most valuable resource
you need to allow space for them to excel at their unique skills and
strengths.</p>
<p>Taking both benefits and disadvantages into consideration, let’s look
at how typical ‘orange’ organizations handle job titles and job
descriptions.</p>
<h2 id="orange-job-titles">Orange job titles</h2>
<p>In a more traditional ‘orange’ organization there are
industry-standard job titles. It can be compared to a puzzle piece where
there is a checklist to find a perfect fit to complete the puzzle.</p>
<p>The key characteristics of typical ‘orange’ training include:</p>
<h3 id="industry-standard-titles">1. Industry standard titles</h3>
<p>Although different organizations may have different understandings of
a specific job title, on average, job titles are known and understood
within any industry. Most people, for example, share an understanding of
what the role of project manager, designer, developer, customer support
specialist, marketing manager, accountant, etc. may entail.</p>
<p>Finding a puzzle piece to complete your organizational puzzle will
typically start with this job title, followed by a more specific and
unique job description. This job description typically outlines a list
of responsibilities, skills, qualifications, and experience required for
the job.  It clearly defines the boundaries of decision-making and
responsibility.</p>
<p>The focus is predominantly on academic achievements and previously
having had similar job titles when selecting a candidate.</p>
<h3 id="clear-career-progression">2. Clear career progression</h3>
<p>In a traditional ‘orange’ organization there is a clearly defined
hierarchy in a vertical career path. Although it is possible to move
horizontally, success is usually measured by climbing the proverbial
corporate ladder. Once you reach the top, going back to a more tactical
role is usually seen as negative, even a demotion.</p>
<p>The career progression plan is clearly defined and in larger
organizations, there are specific requirements as to how long you have
to be in a role in order to progress to the next level. This makes
movement within an organization hard.  Restructuring typically is
something big and slow and impacts everyone.</p>
<h3 id="boundaries-around-decision-making">3. Boundaries around decision
making</h3>
<p>Probably the most significant difference between ‘orange’ and ‘teal’
organizations is how boundaries around decision-making are defined.</p>
<p>In a typical ‘orange’ organization roles have clear boundaries around
responsibilities and decision-making. A junior person has little to no
decision-making power, whereas a senior has much more decision-making
power.</p>
<p>The job title defines the decision-making power of any
individual.</p>
<h2 id="teal-job-titles">Teal job titles</h2>
<p>Rather than viewing job titles as puzzle pieces that have to be a
perfect fit to complete the picture, in a ‘teal’ organization a more <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/07/06/metaphorical-food-thought/">suitable
metaphor</a> is that of a jazz band.  Each member is equally skilled in
the basics of music, and has mastered an instrument to such an extent
that they are able to improvise and respond easily.  The band members
complement each other and play together in an aligned, harmonious
way.</p>
<p>An organization operating from a mainly teal paradigm is distributed,
meaning there is no hierarchy or career ladder to follow. In such a
fluid structure each person can become anything and change is the status
quo. There are no managers or bosses.</p>
<p>Below are the key characteristics in more detail:</p>
<h3 id="titles-dont-reflect-decision-making-power">1. Titles don’t
reflect decision-making power</h3>
<p>Job titles don’t reflect decision-making power within an organization
as in a typical ‘orange’ organization. Boundaries in terms of
decision-making are defined on a project level.</p>
<p>Decision-making is distributed in a ‘teal’ organization.
Self-organizing and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/09/18/autonomous-teams/">autonomous
teams</a> have full decision-making power. The person who discovers the
problem is the one to respond to it. No one waits for the manager to
decide or has to ask permission.</p>
<h3 id="roles-rather-than-titles">2. Roles rather than titles</h3>
<p>Titles in a <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">‘teal’
organization</a> reflect a specific role rather a defined list of
responsibilities. The roles are like containers for a core function of
the organization. For example, <a
href="https://app.holaspirit.com/public/livesciences-ag">Livesciences</a>
have a core purpose of catalyzing change. The primary role within the
organization is that of catalyst. There are, however, also other roles
such as talent, growth and administrators.</p>
<p>What makes it different is that the role of catalyst isn’t a role
well-known in the industry, like “Consultant” or <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/08/19/agile-coaching/">“Agile
coach”</a>. It is more specific to the core purpose of the organization.
Thus, the primary difference is that role labels support communicating
the purpose of the organization to the outside world.  It’s not fitting
existing roles and titles to the organization, rather, it is creating
roles and titles to reflect the unique structure of the
organization.</p>
<h3 id="personality-please">3. Personality please!</h3>
<p>Another key characteristic of a teal organization is the concept of
wholeness. That means each person can bring their whole self to the
office – whether virtual or in person.   They don ’t have to leave their
soul at the door while they step into their professional persona.  They
bring their personality, likes, and dislikes – of course with respect
for others – to the workplace.</p>
<p>While the roles help give form to how a person fits into an
organization, each person can choose their own ‘tagline’.  These
taglines typically highlight an individual’s strengths.</p>
<p>Going back to <a
href="https://livesciences.com/who-we-are/">Livesciences</a>, each
catalyst is uniquely described to the world.  There is the “chameleon”
and the “equalizer” or the “walking library”.  No two catalysts are
exactly the same.  They are no longer defined by what they do, but who
they are.</p>
<h3 id="needs-based-job-descriptions">4. Needs based job
descriptions</h3>
<p>Another key difference is that a typical ‘teal’ job specification,
compared to the ‘orange’ checklist of skills, is that it is much
shorter, often only one or two paragraphs of text. Job descriptions are
typically more conversational compared to the bullet list of an orange
checklist of requirements for any roles. It explains the need that the
role hopes to meet, not the solution.</p>
<p>This is often in the form of describing the problem and constraints
around the role. For example, in a <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/09/19/software-development/">software
development environment</a>, one developer might be an excellent problem
solver but don’t have the technical experience.  Another might have the
technical experience but might not be strong problem-solving skills.
Rather than say no to both because they don’t meet the checklist, they
might be considered, possibly even pairing the two.  In essence, it’s
not about finding a perfect fit.  It’s about discovering the qualities
and skills and making space for that.</p>
<p>Purpose and attitude is more important than skills.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>Below is a possible roadmap to transition to a more teal way to
handle job titles.</p>
<h3 id="define-the-core-roles">1. Define the core roles</h3>
<p>Foundational to a teal way of operating is defining the purpose and
the roles needed to achieve this purpose. The first step to
transitioning to a teal way of operating is to take a step back and
strategically define the core roles, or circles of responsibility within
the organization.  What are the core skills and capabilities you need to
achieve the organizational purpose?</p>
<p>Define these core role definitions in a collaborative process where
all the voices are included from the get-go, for example with an <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/04/25/appreciative-inquiry/">appreciative
inquiry</a> workshop.</p>
<h3 id="add-roles-to-existing-job-titles">2. Add roles to existing job
titles</h3>
<p>Once the core roles have been agreed upon, add these roles to the
existing job titles for a transitional period. The old job titles remain
unchanged while the new roles are tried on for size and adapted if
needed.</p>
<p>Start referring to the roles and adapt all communication – whether
internal or external – to reflect these new roles.  Give everyone the
authority to amend any documentation or artefacts within the
organization that reflect the old job titles.</p>
<p>Whenever a new person is hired, refer to the new role. Rather than
explicitly replacing job tiles, allow the old job titles to naturally
disappear over time.</p>
<h3 id="personalize-titles">3. Personalize titles</h3>
<p>Finally, once the roles are accepted and readily used within the
organization, it’s time to add some personality and invite each person
to personalize their tiles or taglines to better reflect their unique
contribution and their strengths.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Handling job titles is possibly the hardest part of a teal
transformation.  Who will you be in an organization where there are no
bosses?</p>
<p>Teal organizations are whole organizations.  Each person is as unique
as a fingerprint and brings their whole self to work.  Job titles
reflect this goal of wholeness.  Job titles also reflect that there is
also no hierarchy, only a shared purpose everyone works towards.  No one
person is more important than the next.  There are only different jobs
to be done in order to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p>Are you ready to transition to a more teal way of working?</p>

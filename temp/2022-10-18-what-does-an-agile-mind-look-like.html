    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">What does an agile mind look like?</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>
<p class="date">2016-08-09T08:53:44.215Z</p>
</header>
<p>In a well-articulated post by Stephen Denning on <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/whats-missing-in-the-agile-manifesto-mindset/">what’s
missing from the agile manifesto</a>, the conclusion was that the single
most important element of being agile was not included in the manifesto,
namely having an agile mindset.</p>
<p>The post highlights a number of very pertinent issues, first of which
is the focus on process and tools rather than the values behind agile.
It also looks at why traditional management mindsets are inherently not
agile, and how during crisis times so many companies fall back into
their old habits.</p>
<p>What it doesn’t, however, cover in detail, is what an agile mind
looks like, and this is what I would like to address in this post. So
let’s jump right in.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-an-agile-mind-look-like">What does an agile mind look
like?</h1>
<h2 id="an-agile-mind-is-a-flexible-mind.">1. An agile mind is a
flexible mind.</h2>
<p>An agile mind welcomes and embraces change and is not upset with any
change in the workplace that is presented, whether in a crisis situation
or not. You easily adapt and get excited when something new and unusual
is presented to you.</p>
<p>Whether you have to perform the same old task that you’ve done
hundreds of times before or something totally new that you’ve never done
before, you welcome it and find a way to make it pleasurable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You see boredom and irritation as an opportunity to automate or
innovate and fear or overwhelm as a challenge to grow. A crisis is seen
as the perfect situation to innovate.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>An agile mind stops and asks what the goal of the task is before
jumping in and doing it. An agile mind first focuses on the best way to
achieve the goal at hand and rarely fall into habitual
responses.</em></p>
<p>An agile mind isn’t a creature of habit, and first critically analyze
whether steps that made sense previously are still the best way to
achieve your goal, knowing that with this iteration you know more than
what you did before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An agile mind constantly looks for ways to do the same work
easier and better.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means you need a lot of tools in your toolset and constantly
learn more tools, technologies, and methods and that is where the Scrum
Framework and other methods are useful.</p>
<p>It means your brain is actively rewiring itself each time you do
work, like a brain gym. And that means a healthy and flexible mind with
more roads that lead to Rome than simply the congested highway of past
habits.</p>
<h2 id="an-agile-mind-is-a-curious-mind.">2. An agile mind is a curious
mind.</h2>
<p>An agile mind is an open mind that never stops asking questions. Like
a little child, an agile mind is infinitely curious about everything and
everyone. It never accepts instructions without understanding the
purpose behind it and is not afraid to ask to clarify anything that is
not clear. An agile mind actively listens when spoken to and ask more
questions than what it gives answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when you thought you knew all the answers, they went and changed
all the questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An agile mind realizes that there will always be something that you
don’t know and isn’t afraid to admit that you don’t know the answer. An
agile mind isn’t intimidated being surrounded by people that know more
on a certain topic than you. <em>An agile mind believes that two heads
are better than one. <strong>An agile mind is focused curiously on
finding solutions to problems.</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="an-agile-mind-is-a-focused-mind.">3. An agile mind is a focused
mind.</h2>
<p>An agile mind is disciplined and focused on the goal at all times. It
is not easily distracted and it doesn’t multi-task.</p>
<p>When you commit to a task, you put all your energy into the work at
hand and you get things done. Regardless of any disruptions around you,
you find ways to set your attention on your goal without blaming the
disruptions for not meeting a deadline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You find a way to deliver even when there are obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You focus on the outcome, not all the reasons why it is hard to meet
the outcome, and find creative ways to deliver regardless.</p>
<h2 id="an-agile-mind-changes-perspective-easily.">4. An agile mind
changes perspective easily.</h2>
<p>An agile mind is an empathic mind, and like De Bono’s 7 Hats, is able
to change perspective to any of the stakeholders’ viewpoint for a better
understanding of the product at hand.</p>
<p>That means that an agile mind intimately knows not only their team
members but also their customers and are always finding ways to meet
their needs. Whether it is your Product Owner, your colleague
responsible for a different part of the code, or the support staff
handling customer complaints, an agile mind tries to understand the
needs of everyone around them and how they can serve these stakeholders
better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agile mind cares about how end-users are using their product and
how it makes a difference in the world. It is interested in uncovering
pain points in the user journey and how to wow and delight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An agile mind tries to understand, finding the intersections and
crosspoints between different perspectives rather than trying to justify
or defend their point of view.</p>
<h2 id="an-agile-mind-is-a-simple-mind.">5. An agile mind is a simple
mind.</h2>
<p>An agile mind is constantly looking for ways to simplify, for
creating order out of chaos. Whether it is the code base, the product
design or the steps to deliver the work, an agile mind is constantly
decluttering and making the most of what it has.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is the highest form of sophistication. — Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An agile mind is a resourceful mind, being able to deliver with the
least amount of resources. It knows that the fewer choices you have, the
faster it is to make a decision. It knows that more resources doesn’t in
actual fact speed you up and has good judgment to know when to say no,
and when to say yes to more. More tools, more procedures, more
requirements, even more customers.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It’s relatively easy to <strong>do agile.</strong> Doing agile is
about following the recommendations in the guides and learning the
technical skills involved in delivering agile.</p>
<p>It’s much harder, however, to <strong>be agile</strong>. Being agile,
requires mastering the values and soft skills such as responsibility,
trust, focus and discipline which will guide your actions and your
decisions.</p>
<p>An agile mind has mastered both the technical skills and the soft
skills required to enable you to respond to changing needs from your
environment and customer.</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="building-continuous-improvement-habits">Building continuous
improvement habits</h2>
<p>First there was Scrum, then there was Agile. When Scrum became
popular in the mainstream it revolutionized the way work was done.
Micro-management moved towards self-managing teams, delegating work to
the team moved towards the teams pulling the work. Bliss.</p>
<p>Strangely, it all felt very familiar. That is probably because it
was.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the mechanics of Scrum, it’s inherently Lean,
a philosophy of work and business that became popular in manufacturing
when Toyota was faced with increasing competition and lower profit
margins. Now famous, the Toyota Way is a comprehensive system and
business philosophy consisting of Lean practices, together with a number
of other tools and methods that resulted in the awe-inspiring success
that followed Toyota for nearly a century.</p>
<h2 id="kai-zen">Kai-zen</h2>
<p>One of the tools, and probably one of the most important ones, that
made Toyota turn around their sinking ship into the preferred automobile
provider worldwide, is Kaizen, a Japanese word that can roughly be
interpreted as building a culture of continuous improvement, like a
hoola-hoop that keeps turning around as long as there’s motion.</p>
<p>The word <em>“continuous improvement”</em> however dilutes the
meaning in so many ways to me, coming from highly regulated environments
where ISO standards were followed and continuous improvement synonymous
with unreasonable managers who weren’t involved in the operational side
but kept raising the bar under the flag of continuous improvement. When
I hear the word, it brings up a feeling of resistance in my stomach
reminding me how people were expected to do more with less resources,
always emphasizing how what has been done was never good enough.</p>
<p>It took me walking away from the corporate world to gain perspective
and realize the true meaning of what continuous improvement is really
about and why it made Toyota so successful.</p>
<p>If Kaizen, or continuous improvement, is not working for you, it’s
possible that the meaning of the word has been lost or misunderstood.
Here’s how to build a culture of Kaizen and improve agility.</p>
<h1 id="a-habit-of-improvement">A Habit Of Improvement</h1>
<p>Kaizen is a habit. Kaizen is a culture. Kaizen is a tool to make life
easier. It’s a tool to reduce waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it’s not easy, it’s not Kaizen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaizen is usually born out of frustration or bottlenecks in the
process. It can of course be applied at any point in the value chain,
yet it becomes necessary when there is a build-up at any point in the
process.</p>
<p>Kaizen should be applied whenever someone in the team is frustrated.
Whether you’re waiting for another team to complete a part of the system
before you can continue, or you’re tired of repeating the same, old,
boring work over and over again, if it doesn’t feel good, it might be a
good cue to look at Kaizen.</p>
<p>So how do you do it right? How do you build a culture of Kaizen?</p>
<h2 id="observe-objectively">1. Observe Objectively</h2>
<p>There is a saying in the world of quality management that what gets
measured, gets done. You’re not able to improve anything if you don’t
know how it is currently performing. The first step is to objectively
observe the entire process and obtain baseline measures against which
improvements are based on.</p>
<p>In manufacturing it is easy to measure time spent on a task or
process as everything can be seen. In software development or knowledge
work, it’s less tangible and it is up to the team to be disciplined
enough to measure their work effort themselves. In manufacturing, the
facts speak for themselves. In knowledge work, only you will know
whether you were spending that time surfing the internet or really doing
the work that you said you did.</p>
<p>The first step is to <em>visualize</em> the work on a Kanban board,
as a standard Scrum board is not sufficient to identify process
waste.</p>
<p>The second step would be to <em>measure</em> each activity’s
duration. As there are always outliers in any process, there should be
enough comparable instances to define a reasonable and realistic
baseline average before deciding what the improved target should be.</p>
<h2 id="total-flow">2. Total Flow</h2>
<p>The single biggest flaw of industrialization, and also it’s biggest
strength, is the fragmentation of work and parts of a system into small,
repeatable parts. In a typical company, there is an invisible barrier
between Finance and Marketing, between Development and Support, even
between requirements gathering and programming.</p>
<p>Each part of the value chain is responsible for one, unique part of
the system, allowing them to drill down into detail and optimize on a
micro level. Of course, this makes sense and is one of the reasons why
it is possible to improve the whole system.</p>
<p>Yet, this is also most often the breakdown of the system, where teams
are so focused on their own results and responsibilities that they
forget the systemic nature of the organization they are part of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re doing Kaizen wrong if you don’t include the entire value chain
in your improvement efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are as weak as your weakest link and with an average of 10–15%
productivity in most software development companies, the cross-team or
cross-divisional handovers and relationships are the biggest area for
improvement.</p>
<p><em>Keep the impact on the entire system in mind when improving one
part. <strong>When an improvement in one area doesn’t result in an
improvement in the total lead time, there has been no
improvement.</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="remain-open-to-alternatives">3. Remain Open To Alternatives</h2>
<p>Our education system has moulded people who are trying to find the
‘right’ answer, refraining from offering an answer that might
potentially be wrong. We’re scared to make mistakes and as a result
we’re not open to alternatives offered which doesn’t seem obvious that
it might result in an improvement.</p>
<p>Kaizen however requires an openness, a <em>“Yes and”</em> attitude to
problem solving, not a <em>“No but”</em> one. When someone offers an
improvement suggestion which might not sound like a good alternative,
remain open and try it anyway. Refrain from saying no to any solution
offered by anyone, whether they are part of the team involved or not.
It’s often easier to spot an obvious error from the outside than when
you’re part of the team.</p>
<p><em>View it is a learning experience and allow people to make
mistakes. Even if an improvement suggestion doesn’t work, try it and see
what you can learn from the experiment rather than seeing it as a
failure. Maybe the suggestion didn’t work but it pointed out another
improvement area.</em></p>
<h2 id="do-it-now">4. Do It Now</h2>
<p>If you’re waiting for a new resource to join or software to be
approved in the new budget year or training, it’s not Kaizen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start where you are and work with what you’ve got.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaizen is about <em>small</em> changes, things that can easily be
done right now as an experiment to see whether it works before investing
in resources to build it. In software development it often happens that
solutions are identified as things external to the existing environment
and a lot of time and money is invested in for example recruiting new
people or buying new tools, all which doesn’t make much sense if you’re
not even sure whether it will solve the problem yet.</p>
<p><em>View improvements as experiments.</em> Try a number of small
things that can be done immediately. When you walk out of the
retrospective, have <strong>one</strong> actionable improvement
suggestion that can be done right away rather than a list of ten that
you only talked about.</p>
<h2 id="iterative-process">5. Iterative Process</h2>
<p>Kaizen is an iterative process, not a once-off project. Try one thing
at a time, measure to see whether it improved the lead time or not, and
then try something else. Once you’ve got the results, repeat. Repeat
again. And again. And again…</p>
<p>Don’t make too many changes at once as it is hard to see the impact
of the change when there are many changes done at one time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t stop when you’ve reached your target. Targets are meant to be
exceeded, not met.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaizen is a culture, it’s a habit of continuous improvement. It’s not
a destination. Essentially, Kaizen is about building better habits, and
the best way to build habits are to make it easy, achievable and
repeating it.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>For Kaizen to be successful, it has to become a culture. It’s a
continuous focus on getting a <em>little</em> better at what you are
doing already, everyday. It’s not a constant criticism of what is going
wrong and should be changed.</p>
<p>Kaizen is a step-by-step approach to optimizing the total system
where small changes are made continuously, rather than big changes done
once a year.</p>
<p><em>How can you improve your work process for the better?
Now?</em></p>

<h2 id="weathering-the-storm">Weathering the storm</h2>
<p>In Greek mythology Achilles, born as a mortal to an immortal mother,
was made to be immortal by his mother dipping him in sacred water
holding him by his heels. She didn’t realize that the parts of his body
untouched by the sacred water remained vulnerable and mortal. During the
Trojan war this great, unbeatable warrior fell when a poisoned arrow hit
his vulnerable and mortal heel and the term Achilles heel became
synonymous with a weakness in someone seemingly invincible.</p>
<p>In the modern world our battles are different than what it used to be
during ancient Greek and Rome. Our current day battles are between
minds, not fists and swords. Communication is now the single biggest
weapon in a word of words and thoughts.</p>
<p>Yet, each tool has it’s limitations and weakness. In communicating
with others, our Achilles heel is something often seen as a peace keeper
rather than an enemy, making it even more dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="our-achilles-heel">Our Achilles heel</h2>
<p>Have you ever refrained from saying what you truly think of a
solution or a behavior, just to keep the peace? Have you ever talked
around a subject to avoid any criticism from your peers? Have you ever
tried to hide information, intentionally leaving it out in a fear of
hurting someone else’s feelings, or possibly scared of being
punished?</p>
<p>That’s our Achilles heel.</p>
<p><em>Feedback.</em></p>
<p><em>Either not getting any feedback, or not doing anything with the
feedback we’ve received, both are detrimental to the ultimate success of
a team. When even one member in the team refuses to give or receive
feedback, they put the entire team at risk.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Being agile means that you are able to adapt to the changing
environment around you. Without adequate feedback loops, you’re not
agile.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feedback loops are built into agile practices, yet it doesn’t ensure
that it is used correctly. It’s up to each individual in the team, not
only the leader, to commit to honest communication whatever it takes for
a team to succeed.</p>
<p>You have to weather a storm together before you move towards a highly
productive team.</p>
<h2 id="the-character-traits-of-good-communicating-teams">The character
traits of good communicating teams</h2>
<p>All great teams I’ve worked in, had people who were exceptionally
good with communication. Specifically, they had three characteristics
which resulted in great communication:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Each person knew what their and the rest of the team’s
<strong><em>responsibilities</em></strong> were. The respected their
individual <strong><em>boundaries</em></strong> and knew who to ask for
what and when.</li>
<li>No one was afraid to <strong><em>engage in conflict</em></strong>
when discrepancies or disagreements popped up, which also implies a
<strong><em>commitment to honesty</em></strong>. Sometimes it got
personal, other times it felt like a soap opera or drama. But once the
drama’s over, we were closer than before and even better at getting the
work done. Never did someone keep quiet or engaged in passive aggressive
behavior to maintain the false image of harmony.</li>
<li>Everyone had <strong><em>great relationships</em></strong> with both
the team and the customers during working hours and after. If you’re not
willing to go out and have a beer with your team and your customers, you
shouldn’t be working with them, it’s as simple as that. I’ve never seen
an instance where people who dislike each other have good, effective
communication.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s the conversations next to the coffee machine and in the
corridors that make the organizational wheels turn.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They all also underwent the storming phase of team development once
everyone settled into their domain. Storms, however, are never pleasant,
which is why it doesn’t make any sense reshuffling teams after each
sprint.</p>
<h2 id="stormy-waters">Stormy waters</h2>
<p>I vividly remember the best team I’ve ever worked with engaging in a
full-contact, emotionally, conflict session unexpectedly after a
training session on team facilitation practices.</p>
<p>It started with one person subtly complaining about another person in
the team. We saw the red flag and asked whether we should continue and
the facilitator allowed it, inviting the person that was criticized to
respond. I tried to become invisible where I was seated, hoping that
I’ll be exempt from the waves crashing around me.</p>
<p>However, no-one was left out. Everyone in the team was included in
the emotional onslaught with each person throwing more coal on the fire
in defense of their standpoint. Ultimately, the entire team’s weaknesses
and dislikes were ruthlessly and boldly put on the table for everyone to
see.</p>
<h2 id="bruised-ego">Bruised ego</h2>
<p>It took my sensitive and shamed ego a few days to recover after the
onslaught. I know I’m not perfect, but I try my best and growing up in a
house where absolutely everything about me was always criticized, I
dread the pain that is inflicted by harsh words. No matter how hard I
tried to do my best, it was never good enough and to this day still
isn’t.</p>
<p>It was with shame that I walked into the office the next day knowing
what each person <em>really</em> thought of me. I knew exactly what I
did to annoy each person and they knew exactly what I disliked about
them.</p>
<p>I don’t know what hurt more, yet somehow, it hurts more being the
truth teller than receiving an uncomfortable truth. It’s so much easier
to be the hurt one than to see someone else hurt, knowing you were the
one that caused it. It always, however, hurts more not knowing what
other people think than having to deal with an uncomfortable truth,
something I’ve had to do many times in my life.</p>
<p>No secrets or skeletons were left in the cupboard during the session
and we all hurt for a while as we processed the stab to our ego’s.</p>
<h2 id="the-phoenix-rises-from-the-ashes">The phoenix rises from the
ashes</h2>
<p>Yet, I was wonderfully surprised to discover that after the dust has
settled, I was more liked and more appreciated by the team. <em>By
allowing myself to engage in the conflict as the new person in the team,
I proved my worthiness to be part of the team. It was as if I’ve
received a rite of passage and were finally accepted as part of the
team. With my weaknesses. In fact, exposing my weaknesses was what made
me more likable.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly we were all just human. Just people with emotions,
irritations, dislikes, bad days and good ones. The crude exposure of our
innermost emotions to each other made us in a way more acceptable to
each other. We all realized that the one was as guilty as the next.
There was no super human among us, or the belief that there ever will
be. We all had our strengths and we all had some weakness. I wasn’t any
different from the others and had no reason to feel ashamed.</p>
<p>It was as if the dark, stormy clouds gave way to the sun to shine
through.</p>
<h2 id="the-gift">The gift</h2>
<p>The shame dissolved in the light of the sun and what surfaced was
<em>awareness</em>. The knowing what each person’s weakness is as well
as my own and that we are all human.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The awareness that surfaced after the conflict was what changed
everything going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that the elephant in the room had a name, we weren’t so scared to
call it out when it happened and we didn’t take offense when it was,
trying to protect our fragile ago. The obstacles that kept the team from
performing were cleared and we could focus on the work without spending
so much time and energy trying to tiptoe trying to get around the
elephant anymore.</p>
<p>Strangely, the whole drama made us all feel so much
<strong><em>safer</em></strong>, able to express our deepest
frustrations with each other without any repercussions. It was as if
suddenly what was our individual weaknesses, our Achilles heels, now was
what gave us extra protection.</p>
<p>It was no longer seen as criticism, but rather protection when the
elephant was called out by either one. There were no more shadows, no
more secrets and we were <em>better than ever</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-choice">The choice</h2>
<p>It’s not often though that an entire team is willing to be so
vulnerable in front of each other. In fact, this was the only team who
totally committed to being vulnerable in front of each other and it was
the only team who ever made the impossible possible.</p>
<p>Other teams I’ve worked with either avoided the conflict in fear of
criticism, or only some of the more outspoken team members engaged in
the teams where we did reach the inevitable stormy phase of team
building.</p>
<p>It’s always a choice. Being vulnerable can never be forced upon
someone and when there is a risk of being fired, chances are close to
zero that anyone would be willing to embrace such a session.</p>
<p>We were also presented with a further choice after the session.</p>
<p>Each one in the team was free to take the feedback and attempt to
improve, or ignore it. All of us chose to take it and change. With that,
our mortal parts became invincible. The team was stronger than ever,
united and supported on all fronts. <em>Unstoppable.</em></p>
<p>The sad truth however is that most people are afraid to be vulnerable
and would rather choose to protect their ego and image to the outside
world than be honest about what they really think and feel.
<strong><em>These teams will never reach their full
potential.</em></strong> They might be good, but they will never be
great. It takes accepting the whole package, the good and the bad, for
high performing teams to exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only choice you ever need to make is between your ego and your
true desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>What do you choose? False harmony while you remain in the harbor
or stormy seas as you venture to new destinations?</em></p>

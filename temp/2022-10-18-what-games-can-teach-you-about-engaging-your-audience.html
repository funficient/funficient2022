    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">What games can teach you about engaging your
audience</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Want to engage your customers? Play more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone is looking for ways to engage users — whether they are an
employer, a marketer or an educator — we are struggling to get and then
keep the attention of the people we are trying to speak to.</p>
<p>This post will explore what engagement is, and provide some practical
tools on how to engage people based on lessons learnt from games. But
first, what does it mean to engage someone?</p>
<p>Engagement is really about getting someone’s attention and keeping it
for long enough to get your message across. Sounds easy, but in a noisy
world where everyone seems to be screaming for airtime, not so easy to
do.</p>
<p>Especially if you’re the new kid on the block.</p>
<p>But games manage to get it right all the time, so what exactly is it
that makes games so engaging? And how can we use that in our work
environment to get the same results without patronizing or insulting our
people?</p>
<h1 id="include-an-element-of-surprise">1. Include An Element of
Surprise</h1>
<p>Habits are one of the most powerful things and if it wasn’t for
habits, there would be a lot more road accidents for one. But habits are
also one of the most boring things and the more predictable, the less
interesting something is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To engage your audience you need to find a way to break your
predictable habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do or say something that your audience doesn’t expect.</p>
<p>Try stopping sending out your regular newsletter for a few weeks.
People might not immediately notice, not consciously in anycase, that
you didn’t send it out, but when you start sending it out again, they
will notice that you are back and will want to see what you are saying
and what they missed.</p>
<p>Another example of how adding something unexpected (like sound) to
something not usually associated with sound (a trashcan) engaged
bypassers, watch this video called <a
href="https://youtu.be/tcrhp-IWK2w">The World’s Deepest Trash Bin</a>.
Not only were the users engaged, their behavior was changed as a result
of the change.</p>
<h1 id="the-goldilocks-effect">2. The Goldilocks effect</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teaching teenagers are probably the hardest demographic group to
communicate to as an educator, and trying to engage them sometimes seems
like an impossible quest.</p>
<p>I discovered that even though they were able to recite the correct
answers with the resources at hand in class, they didn’t comprehend and
thus remember a thing once they left the classroom. I started playing
Junior Scrabble with them as a warmer using cards rather than the board,
only to discover that they struggled to come up with simple 3 letter
words, let alone use it in a sentence.</p>
<p>I dumped the books, as even though it was excellent books and easy
enough with everything indicating that it was the correct resource to
use, it was way too hard for them, but they weren’t willing to loose
face and admit it in front of their peers. The ‘dumbed down’ version of
the class immediately got them engaged and increased their learning
exponentially.</p>
<p>Similarly, in order to get your message across, you need to speak the
language of the recipient, not the other way around. You need to figure
out what your audience wants to know, what questions they have that you
can answer and what language they will understand. Simple language is
usually the best.</p>
<h1 id="provide-a-purpose">3. <em>Provide a purpose</em></h1>
<p>If people feel that they are part of something, rather than simply
being a passive observer, they immediately are more engaged and likely
to act or respond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The question you need to ask is how can I involve my audience
more in my work?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be as simple as asking for comments or completing a poll, but
more powerful is to include them in a real project. Crowdsource a simple
task, or ask them to help you define your requirements or test. And then
use it and do what they suggested. Nothing as bad as being asked for my
opinion and then ignoring it. <em>Give your audience a real-world
challenge. Make them part of the solution.</em></p>
<p>In the classroom I embarked on a project to translate a novel that a
student wrote, and for an excellent example of how this was done to gain
more followers before the launch of a movie, look at <a
href="https://youtu.be/VpuC7HhCPWA">The Dark Knight marketing
campaign</a> to see how thousands of people acted out real life
challenges before the launch.</p>
<h1 id="change-it.-often.">4. Change it. Often.</h1>
<p>It is important to be consistent in your message and in your
marketing, however it is as important to change your content and your
message from time to time.</p>
<p>From my personal experience, I cannot tell you how many influential
people I’ve discovered and were hooked on their materials, but as soon
as I’ve figured out their essence, they bored me and I unsubscribed. I
still love and respect them and listen to their opinions, but I lost
interest in their regular communication and don’t even open their posts
on Twitter.</p>
<p>No matter how good your message, in order to engage an audience you
need to keep changing. Change the frequency of your message, add a
different perspective, try partnering with someone that complements your
service, rebrand, or add new products and services from time to
time.</p>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind is to find a balance between
consistency and freshness. You are aiming for fresh, not inconsistent or
being perceived not knowing who you are yourself. People love ‘new’. New
perspectives, new knowledge, new partnerships. Keep it fresh.</p>
<h1 id="keep-secrets">5. Keep secrets</h1>
<p>There is nothing that elicits curiosity such as leaving out essential
information. That is why we love puzzles and mystery novels or series on
TV. We love not knowing who the guilty party is and will watch until
we’ve figured it out. But once we know all the answers, we loose
interest.</p>
<p>To engage your audience, keep something from them that will give them
a reason to come back. End with a question, or leave out something not
so obvious that will keep them wondering what is coming next. Be one
step ahead and always know where you are heading.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Engagement is about making something interesting and looking at games
can teach us a lot about how to engage our audience.</p>
<p>So next time you’re out of ideas or feel stuck, pull out a game and
play.</p>

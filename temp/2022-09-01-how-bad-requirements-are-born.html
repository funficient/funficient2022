<h1 class="title">How bad requirements are born</h1>

<h2 id="a-case-for-getting-rid-of-the-tools">A case for getting rid of
the tools</h2>
<p>I was born in the age before there were any tools to manage
requirements or workflow. Lucky me.</p>
<p>When I started working with systems the person who interacted with
the customer was the one responsible for defining the need and giving it
through to the developers. Usually using conversations, occasionally
followed up with an email if it was really complex. It wasn’t seen as a
separate role, it was merely seen as a feedback loop as part of the
development process.</p>
<p>It made sense and it worked. The person that became aware of the
customer need was the one to raise it. The team I worked with didn’t
need processes to drive our decision making. We all had common sense,
took responsibility and spoke to each other daily. Mostly because we
liked speaking to each other and either putting our heads together to
solve a problem, or dream about what-if scenarios. There wasn’t any
Facebook or LinkedIn at the time either. Our connections were real.</p>
<p>And we had so much fun! We couldn’t wait to get together and save the
world with technology. No problem was too big and no requirement not
taken up seriously. It was better than any badge or leader board to know
you were responsible for solving a customer’s problems, feeling like
hero’s everyday.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>I accidentally got involved in a software development project that
was close to impossible at the start of my career. I was young,
inexperienced and testing and requirements were part of development,
there were no courses or roles that separated it from software
engineer.</p>
<p>3 months, 3 people to deliver one fully integrated and compliant
casino monitoring and controlling system.</p>
<p>The next 3 months we spent mainly chatting to each other and soon
became friends. The genius front-end developer and the Iranian (or was
he Iraqi? I always got it wrong which fueled a passionate discussion on
the difference) who handled the firmware and hardware integration.</p>
<p>We came from diverse backgrounds and had different interests and we
cared little about what nationality we were, our political or religious
views. All we cared about was building something awesome and solving a
problem that everyone thought couldn’t be done.</p>
<p><em>We spent more time talking than working but somewhere between
these conversations we spent a few hours working each day and 90 days
later we successfully shipped.</em> We easily made the impossible
possible without any stress or overtime and soon the product was
released worldwide and became the flagship product of the company.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>Fast forward. The system is running in a casino for the first time in
the world and to my dismay I’m the only one who knows how it works and
able to support it, which ends up being needed every 5 minutes due to
some new issue that is discovered. What worked perfectly well in the lab
suddenly was a crisis on the floor. I recall a period where for months I
literally only went home once every 24–48 hours for a quick shower and
maybe get a few minutes of sleep before the next urgent phone call woke
me.</p>
<p><em>After this experience I never looked at documented requirements
again, especially highly legislated ones, for the rest of my career,
realizing how worthless they were compared to real life.</em></p>
<h2 id="integration-can-only-happen-when-youre-connected">Integration
can only happen when you’re connected</h2>
<p>Looking back I’m still amazed at what we did in such a short time
though. The system was a fully integrated end-to-end solution. Slot
machines were monitored to make sure that not a single event is missed
and all coins are accurately accounted for in the accounting system. It
interfaced with the security system, the loyalty system and the food and
beverage system, totally independent third party systems and departments
within the casino.</p>
<p>From a user point of view, however, from the moment you swiped your
loyalty card to gain access to the casino until you left, it was a
seamless and exhilarating experience. If anyone understands what a User
Experience is really about, it’s the entertainment industry. Profit are
directly related to the amount of customers that <em>choose</em> to
spend their money there rather than on anything else.</p>
<p>Compared to the rest of the world, gaming was on the cutting edge of
what technology had to offer and the place to be for anyone who really
loved technology.</p>
<p>That was nearly 20 years ago when internet access was a scarce
resource accessed by a dial-up modem and 5 email accounts for the
casino. Today, with the majority of society having permanent access to
social media and internet, finding an integrated experience is hard.
Just try to contact the bank with a problem on your account or make an
insurance claim to find out exactly how disconnected the world is. It
always seems to be someone else’s fault.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad-1">The bad</h2>
<p>Comparing requirements management then and now, here is a list of the
reasons how bad requirements are born and how to prevent it.</p>
<h2 id="no-relationships">1. No relationships</h2>
<p><em>Requirements are all about conversations. That’s why they call it
user stories.</em></p>
<p>We spent more time chatting than doing work during those 3 months of
development, yet, we did more work than the rest of the company
combined. What was done was done right because we really understood what
was being done and why. And we liked each other. The Aussie, the Iranian
(or is it Iraqi?) and the South African.</p>
<p>We spent hours talking where after it took a few minutes to get the
work done and I could immediately check it and give feedback.
<em><strong>Agile didn’t exist yet, but this was better than
agile.</strong> <strong>No tools, no rules. Only responsible people who
cared.</strong></em></p>
<p>The work was done quickly and correctly because we loved solving
problems with technology, wanted to help each other and understood each
other and what needed to be done. The engineers understood the
requirements and I understood the technical constraints and together we
easily problem-solved if there was a discrepancy.</p>
<p>And there was no-one bugging us to find out how we’re doing and how
long it will take or having to update a workflow system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A workflow system effectively stops the conversations from
happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don’t want to drink a beer or grab a coffee with the people
you work with, you’re in the wrong team. Please go.</p>
<p><em>When people don’t like each other, errors are introduced to the
software and bad requirements are born and built. Building relationships
is the most important tool that any product owner can have. All the
fancy features and reports in Jira or the real-time access of Trello
doesn’t even get close to a just a 5 minute chat with the team.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Get rid of the tools and start building
relationships.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="no-customer-interaction">2. No customer interaction</h2>
<p>I was surprised when I realized that what worked in the isolated lab
environment didn’t work in real life.</p>
<p>After however spending literally 24 hours per day on site and on the
casino floor the first few weeks after launch to sort out these birthing
hiccups, I understood why. <em>I never once spoke to a customer in the
lab, only relying on the legal requirements and the engineer’s
skills.</em></p>
<p>I now spent a lot of time crawling on the floor between the cables
and talking with the slots technicians between 2 and 4 am in the morning
as this was the quiet period. I loved it. It felt connected and it felt
real.</p>
<p><em>I was never too busy to engage in conversation, partly because I
didn’t have to go and update a workflow management system, partly
because I thrived in being able to solve people’s issues. I felt like
wonder woman. It was awesome.</em></p>
<p>If you’re job doesn’t excite you, please go. If you don’t like
speaking to the real users, please reconsider whether the industry is
for you. If you don’t care about what the customers need, please
consider a different career. I’d rather be friends and work with a
passionate barrista than a mediocre CEO.</p>
<p>During these mostly informal interactions I received more insights
into what is important and what not than any amount of documentation or
second-hand messages ever provided. And when there was a need, it was
done within minutes.</p>
<p><em>There was never a need to create a backlog. Either it was
important or not. If it was important, it was done. Immediately. You
only need a to write something down when you take too long and can’t
remember the details anymore. If you call yourself really agile, you
don’t need a backlog.</em></p>
<p>I discovered that it’s not only the punters that use the system and
the IT team that serve them. The slots technicians, the PR team, the
waiters and the surveillance staff in fact use it much more than the
punters and their needs directly affect the ability to serve the paying
customers and the user experience.</p>
<p>I figured out that error code 87672x000 means nothing to anyone,
including the developers who wrote it. I figured out that accounting is
useless if there is not a report to interpret the information. I figured
out that even if the information on the report is perfect but it can’t
be printed or is not available when you need it, it’s useless. I figured
out that a customer doesn’t know the difference between a Bally or an
Atronic or an IGT slot machine or where the machine stops and where the
system starts and they shouldn’t either. All they cared about was
getting their payout.</p>
<p><em>The core role of the product owner is to spend time with the
customers to understand their needs. The real users. Not the ones
selling it, but the ones actually using it. If you’re not getting your
hands dirty and dealing with customer complaints, you are not doing your
job as product owner.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Bad requirements are born when you don’t understand who
actually uses the system and what they need.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="always-agreeing">3. Always agreeing</h2>
<p>One day, I was struggling with a very serious problem involving
jackpot payouts. Every time a jackpot was hit all the servers had to be
restarted, rendering the casino off-line for a few minutes. During peak
hours, this was every few minutes. This would be a very good example of
a blocking issue, I learned.</p>
<p>The IT manager with his god-complex did what managers do. He kept
blaming and nagging, wanting to know why we didn’t pick it up earlier
and when it’s going to be fixed. He had right to be upset because it was
a very serious issue, but we were there within minutes from the time it
was reported, spent the next 48 hours without any sleep troubleshooting,
immediately flew an engineer from Austria out to assist us and had
Australia on the line literally 24/7 trying to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>He was being unreasonable and he was making it impossible for me to
get any work done. After weeks of little to no sleep, I couldn’t take
anymore and lashed out at him and in front of everyone told him to
fffuuccckkk off. In those words.</p>
<p>I continued to explain to him why he was being an asshole and that I
was doing my best and that he wasn’t helping at all. I also explained
that physically, we couldn’t have done anything more and there was no
way to prevent the issue in the first place. The only way to test a
jackpot is either by emulating it, which we did with each manufacturer,
or spending months playing a real machine from each manufacturer hoping
for the 1 in 16 million chance that it will hit. We tested it as good as
we could and there was no way that we could have known that there would
be a difference between the emulated jackpot hit and a real one.
Theoretically, it should have been the same.</p>
<p>He quietly and shocked listened to every word as I spoke, not saying
a word because he knew I was right and he was being unreasonable. He
left me to do my work and within a few more hours the problem was
solved.</p>
<p>At first my colleagues were shocked as you don’t speak to a customer
like that, especially if it’s the IT manager, effectively the most
important person in the casino. Even if they’re wrong. I am however not
like that. I don’t care what your title is. Whether you’re the CEO or
the cleaner, if you’re being an asshole I’m going to tell it to you. You
earn my respect by being good at your job, not the title you wear. When
they however came to me afterwards, they couldn’t stop laughing and
congratulated me for standing up to him. I said what everyone was
thinking, even though I was the youngest in the team.</p>
<p>Our relationship after this encounter was better than ever. There was
a level of respect that wasn’t there before. But I never again relied on
emulations or harnesses to verify whether something works or not. I only
ever tested the <em>real</em> end-to-end workflow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bad requirements are born when you care more about
keeping your manager happy than making sure the software works and
focusing on the actual problem.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Equally, bad requirements are built when you rely on theory, not
reality. Labs are not real.</em></p>
<h2 id="not-understanding-the-problem">4. Not understanding the
problem</h2>
<p>In most cases, what the customer wants is already in the system, they
just need someone to show them how to use it or where to find it. It’s
the product owner’s job to understand why customers are asking for what
they are asking before just reacting and putting it on the backlog.</p>
<p>Usually, what they are asking for is not what they want or what they
need, but they are trying to find a way to express themselves best they
can. When you say yes to everything you’re being asked, you don’t
understand the value of why it is being developed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary role of the product owner is to find the value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What benefit does this new enhancement have? What is the impact of
implementing it? Is it really useful to the actual users?</p>
<p>If you don’t spend time with the customer where they show you why
they need something, it is not possible for you to understand their
need. Understanding a problem has two sides though.</p>
<p>Sometimes, what is a quick win for a customer might be a very
expensive development task, and at other times, what the customer sees
as really difficult, is technically easy and cheap. Your job is not only
to understand the customer’s need, but also the technical implication
and what it will take to build it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bad requirements are born when you build something
without first finding the value.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="formalized-processes-and-hierarchy">5. Formalized processes and
hierarchy</h2>
<p>The best work I did was in the most informal settings. During our 90
day challenge, we didn’t have any daily standups or formal
processes.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. If you’re employing talent, they <em>want</em> to
work and be productive. They don’t want to spend their days updating
tickets just so that someone in the ivory tower has a false sense of
security feeling more in control. They want to feel like hero’s saving
the day with their skills.</p>
<p>The requirements were discussed verbally and feedback was given when
it was needed. There was not a single meeting enforced on us during the
three months and no-one cared whether the requirements were documented
in a system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you need to schedule conversations, there’s a problem.
Conversations should happen in the moment, not when there’s a spot
available in your calendar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I wasn’t clear on something, I walked to the developer.
Actually, I spent more time with the developers in the lab than at my
desk. When the developers were unsure about something, they would ask
me. When the customers later needed something, they phoned and I
immediately reacted. <strong>Everyone was happy. The developers, the
managers, the customers.</strong></p>
<p>But then things changed. We got a team manager. He was good at what
he does and a nice guy and constantly reminded us that management is so
important and necessary now that the company is growing. We sort of
believed him. For a while. Irony is that the only growth in the company
was the addition of him and a marketing manager.</p>
<p>We attended his kids birthday parties and liked each other but things
were never the same again. He did everything managers do. The first,
introducing a weekly team meeting and a monthly meeting with the
customers. I was however too junior and was no longer allowed to speak
directly to the customers and his friend was chosen as the customer
proxy. She was nice and I loved her, but she didn’t understand anything
about networks or techie talk so not really a practical person to have
in these meetings. When the word database or operating system popped up,
her beautiful blue eyes would cross with confusion. She was however very
good at making hot chocolate and teaching people how to use a computer
mouse, so she was very valuable in the team as no-one else wanted to do
that and we all really loved her. But customer service started declining
as more and more requirements were misunderstood or unnecessary due to
the new process that was introduced.</p>
<p>The customers started complaining, the team started bickering. Our
wings were clipped, unable to fly anymore.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we had a schedule to be on-call for customers and had to be
available at certain times. The customers couldn’t phone us directly
anymore and the team was constantly arguing. Previously it was a
non-issue with everyone always being available because they loved being
needed by the customers and able to show their talent in the real
world.</p>
<p>We started having performance appraisals where we were told where
we’re <strong><em>not</em></strong> good enough and everyone hated it
but no-one said anything, silenced by the constant reminders of how this
was better for the company. In truth however, that’s what killed the
culture and was far from good for anyone, including the company.</p>
<p>Then, one day, the gaming board phoned and asked for me. I spent an
hour on the phone explaining something and in the process fast-tracked
the certification process to the benefit of both the customers and the
gaming board. Absolutely no benefit to me personally. But my manager was
furious, a mere junior team member wasn’t allowed to speak directly to
the most important role players in our industry, even though I was
really the only one who knew the answer and they personally asked for
me. I was reprimanded for not following the process he so carefully
designed.</p>
<p>My passion was killed instantly and I was no longer motivated to
spend weekends at work or do anything more than what was required.
Management killed my ability to service our customers and it killed my
productivity. I hated it. I hated not being able to connect directly
with the customers anymore. I hated not being able to solve problems and
use my talent productively.</p>
<p>Where previously I felt I was making a difference, now I felt caged
in. I finally resigned in search of a workplace where I could get some
work done and play less political games.</p>
<p><em>Bad requirements are born when you care more about the roles and
hierarchy of control than the work and making a difference in a real
user’s life.</em></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Good requirements naturally happen when there are good relationships.
The more control you try to impose, the less natural a relationship is,
the worse the requirements become, the more error-prone and disconnected
the system gets.</p>
<p>If you want to be really agile, throw away the tools and the
processes and focus on the relationships in your team and the work.</p>

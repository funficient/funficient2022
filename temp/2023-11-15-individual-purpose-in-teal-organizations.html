<p>Purpose is at the heart of an organization operating from a teal
paradigm.</p>
<p>In a traditional ‘orange’ organization individual purpose falls out
of the scope of the work agreement between an individual and an
employer. What makes an organization more ‘teal’ is actively helping
people discover and be true to their individual purpose.</p>
<p>This post will look at the characteristics of how individual purpose
forms part of a ‘teal’ organization and how to support individuals in
finding their personal destinies.</p>

<h2 id="man-without-meaning">Man without meaning</h2>
<p>Human beings are meaning-making machines. A purpose gives us a sense
of self and with that a sense of belonging. Without having a clear
individual purpose life has little meaning. These people fill their time
in pursuit of worldly pleasures that only bring brief relief from an
insatiable desire within. The hungry ghost within always left yearning
for more.</p>
<p>To satiate this deep desire within, you have to find your individual
purpose. Only then will your life have meaning and will the hungry ghost
fade away.</p>
<h2 id="in-search-of-meaning">In search of meaning</h2>
<p>A favourite book of mine describes this search for meaning and
individual purpose in <a
href="https://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/12/15/10-powerful-life-lessons-from-the-alchemist/">“The
Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo</a>. It’s a simple story with very deep
meaning about a simple shepherd boy who follows his heart after having a
recurring dream of finding a treasure.</p>
<p>The boy decides to sell his sheep and pursue the treasure. A
transformative journey follows, filled with obstacles and challenges
where he learns to trust himself and to listen to his heart. At the end
of the story, he finds his treasure and returns to his beloved whom he
left behind while in search of his individual purpose.</p>
<p>Each time I read the book another layer of wisdom reveals itself to
me. It’s a story of listening to your heart and trusting the universe
while embracing the journey of self-discovery. It contains the secrets
of leading a fulfilling life without losing yourself in the pleasures of
the outside world. It is a call for you to listen to, and follow your
heart.</p>
<h2 id="as-unique-as-a-fingerprint">As unique as a fingerprint</h2>
<p>No two people are the same or want the same thing. Each person has a
unique gift and unique desires. Only when you are true to your inner
calling are you able to find your team? When you become part of a team
who shares the same collective purpose, each individual contributes
their unique skills into a beautiful tapestry.</p>
<p>When you view an organization as a collection of individuals, it
makes sense to help each individual clarify their individual purpose, as
ultimately it will benefit the organization. There is also no need for
<a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/15/competition-in-the-workplace/">competition</a>
when you know each person is unique, with different skills and
strengths. The workplace becomes a collaboration rather than a
competition.</p>
<p>The strengths of each person’s gifts compound, creating a whole
that’s bigger than it’s parts.</p>
<h2 id="ikigai-and-individual-purpose">Ikigai and individual
purpose</h2>
<p>The Japanese calls individual purpose <a
href="https://ikigai-living.com/what-is-ikigai/">Ikigai</a>. That
intersection where what you love, what you’re good at, what the world
needs, and what you get paid for.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Group-11.png"
alt="Image of ikigai, showing the intersection between what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you get paid for." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image of ikigai, showing the intersection
between what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and
what you get paid for.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although this seems simple, most people in today’s world struggle to
find their ikigai. In my personal search for meaning I interviewed a lot
of people.  I asked them what they love to do and what they’re good at.
By far the majority of the people couldn’t answer. In our current
consumer-based society we’re taught that you buy happiness on a shelf. 
It’s a quick-fix culture. Yet, these quick-fixes provide a very brief
high before the emptiness sets in again.</p>
<p>We’re disconnected from our inner purpose and that results in the
worldwide epidemic of loneliness and unhappiness. Loneliness is
ultimately the result of not being able to life your purpose. Thus, the
only way to solve the employee engagement problem sustainably is to help
people find their inner purpose.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-purpose">Organizational purpose</h2>
<p>You can’t separate individual purpose from organizational purpose. An
organization is merely a collection of individuals. The two binding
agents that keep these individuals together are values and purpose.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Frame-3.png"
alt="An image showing the intersection between individual and organizational purpose, included within a bigger whole that contains the environment and society." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An image showing the intersection between
individual and organizational purpose, included within a bigger whole
that contains the environment and society.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An organizational purpose – like ikigai – is an intersection of
individual purpose, and organizational purpose, with environmental and
societal impact considered and included. A typical ‘orange’
organization, on the other hand, has a core purpose of profit, achieved
with a specific mission. They care primarily about short-term gains and
only focus on the organizational goal, often at the detriment of the
environment and the very people who help build this organization.</p>
<h2 id="case-study">Case study</h2>
<p>Toyota back in 2003 stood out as the earliest, and best example of a
purpose-driven company. They managed to increase their shares by 24%
over 2002 while stock prices of the Big 3 were falling. Toyota was bench
marked as the best in its class by all its peers and competitors for
quality, productivity, and flexibility. Their long-term focused
purpose-driven approach was very profitable.</p>
<h3 id="a-short-history">A short history</h3>
<p>The company was born out of needs and solving problems.  Sakichi
Toyoda, a tinkerer and inventor, grew up in the late 1800s in a remote
farming community. He wanted to ease the hard spinning and weaving work
of his mother and grandmother which was a major industry at the time. He
set out to develop power-ridden wooden looms.  These looms eventually
turned into the very successful car manufacturer we today know as
Toyota.</p>
<p>The culture of improving the livelihoods of the people didn’t change
as the company grew.  Their purpose and vision started with the
customary selfish goal of profit, then added the well being of their
employees and their families, and also the importance of making a
positive contribution to society and being responsible to the
environment.</p>
<h3 id="toyotas-purpose">Toyota’s purpose</h3>
<p>If you asked any individual in the company at the time, they would
have told you that the company existed to <em>“satisfy customers,
contribute to society, contribute to the economy, and achieve long-term
prosperity for all employees and partners.”</em> A core part of the
Toyota philosophy was to create mutually beneficial relationships
between the company and its employees.</p>
<p>Their model for success was based on mutual trust that created
prosperity for both company and employee, as can be seen in the diagram
below, as represented in the book <a
href="https://books.google.co.za/books/about/Toyota_Culture_PB.html?id=7Y6jjkmqByQC&amp;redir_esc=y">“Toyota
Culture – The heart and soul of the Toyota Way”</a>.<br />
<img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Frame-21.png"
alt="Image showing the intersection between individual purpose and organizational purpose" />A
key differentiator for Toyota was recognizing that to be profitable in
the long term, they had to care take of the very individuals who help
build the company. The first principle of their philosophy is to base
decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term
financial gains.  They were in it for the long haul from the get-go.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-an-orange-approach-to-purpose">The impact of an
‘orange’ approach to purpose</h2>
<p>Compare this to the typical ‘orange’ organization where people are
seen as replaceable parts in a bigger machine. People are often burned
out by the age of 30 and increasingly complaining about mental health as
well as physical health. <strong>As many as 81% of GenZ’ers reportedly
left roles for mental health reasons</strong>, as discussed in this <a
href="https://hbr.org/2021/10/its-a-new-era-for-mental-health-at-work">Harvard
Business Review article</a> (with a link to the full report). If you’re
still not convinced, here are more statistics from the <a
href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-at-work">World
Health Organization</a>, including an estimated <strong>loss of 12
billion working days</strong> globally due to depression and anxiety. 
This is not a sustainable or healthy environment. When short-term goals
and immediate financial gains trump the long-term sustainability of both
the people and the planet the impact is dire.</p>
<p>The future <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/11/13/generational-employees/">generations</a>
will be most impacted though, and many organizations continue in the
hope they will be retired by the time the pyramids collapse, as all
pyramids eventually do. It is not possible to remain profitable over the
long term when you don’t care to take the very people who build your
empire and the planet they live on.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-support-individual-purpose">How to support individual
purpose</h2>
<p>If you’re reading this post though, you’re probably aware of the
impact of the ‘orange’ short-term approach and looking for practical
ways to help individuals find and fulfil their purpose.  Here are some
easy and accessible ways to help support individuals in finding their
ikigai.</p>
<h3 id="prioritize-individual-wellness">1. Prioritize individual
wellness</h3>
<p>Work-life balance has become an expectation for the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/09/30/millennials-future-leadership/">millennials</a>
and rightly so. A person can not thrive in the work environment when
they are stressed, unhealthy, and unhappy. Include or introduce wellness
practices that will create a more ‘whole’ person.</p>
<p>Maybe it is promoting that no-one works overtime and offering
sabbaticals like <a
href="https://37signals.com/podcast/taking-a-sabbatical-as-a-business-owner/">37Signals</a>
does. This allows for a more balanced life and time to focus on your
personal needs. Or maybe it is adding healthy snacks and allowing time
for group workouts at the office if you are co-located. Or possibly it
is giving massage vouchers and organising team breakouts where you can
focus on relaxation and relationships and not only be productive.</p>
<h3 id="offer-coaching-services">2. Offer coaching services</h3>
<p>Coaching is designed primarily as a tool to raise <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/05/25/self-awareness-workplace/">self-awareness</a>
and assist people in following their hearts. It takes into consideration
the whole person and a typical exercise most <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/11/11/blocks-life-coaching-can-remove/">coaching
journeys start off with is the wheel of life</a>, where each main area
of an individual’s life is rated in terms of personal fulfillment.</p>
<p>A good coach will identify any imbalances. They will focus on
strengthening the weakest part of the wheel while connecting it to the
core focus area the individual chooses to focus on. A good coach will
also be able to identify limiting beliefs and any incongruence between
what a person says, thinks, and does.</p>
<p><em>Coaching, in its essence, is about finding alignment between what
you think, feel, say and do.</em></p>
<p>When people are allowed to shine at work they will naturally
contribute to the organizational purpose. Coaching is the space where
individuals can dare to dream big and go after their goals to grow
individually.</p>
<h3 id="support-growth">3. Support growth</h3>
<p>A goal without the ability to act on it is meaningless and even
demotivating. Coaching might identify individual goals, but the support
of the organization is crucial in making this a profitable return on
investment for the organization.</p>
<p>Create adequate <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/10/20/psychological-safety/">psychological
safety</a> so that individuals can ask for what they truly wish to do,
and then create opportunities where they can do this. Additional to
these opportunities, consider offering <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/10/15/key-elements-of-mentoring/">mentoring</a>
and coaching while the individual explores this new, uncomfortable
territory.  See it like training wheels while you up-skill the
individual.</p>
<p>Make failure acceptable and encourage learning and cultivating a
growth mindset when they don’t get it right the first time. No one can
authentically express themselves when they don’t feel safe. Safety is
always first.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>An organization is a collection of individuals who form part of the
organization. You can’t separate individual purpose from organizational
purpose in a living organism, such as an organization operating from a
teal paradigm.</p>
<p>For long-term success, an organization has to support individual
purposes.  This might include an increased focus on wellness within the
work environment, introducing coaching services, and making career
opportunities available to support individual growth.</p>
<p>Are you ready to transition to a more teal way of working?</p>

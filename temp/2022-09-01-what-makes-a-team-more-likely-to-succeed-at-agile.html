    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

Agile?</h1>

<h2 id="making-agile-an-inside-job">Making agile an inside job</h2>
<p>There are two common ways to become more agile. The one is to invest
in a really good agile coach, which is rather expensive and
inaccessible. Abd to be honest, I’ve only seen two or maybe three people
who I would recommend.</p>
<p><em>Scarce resource. Very scarce.</em></p>
<p>The other, more accessible and affordable way to become more agile,
is to make it an inside job. As apposed to <em>wait</em> for someone to
miraculously <em>make</em> you agile, as if it was something that
happened to you, a much better approach is to take action yourself.</p>
<p>Becoming agile is ultimately a <em>choice</em> that lies only with
you. Either you embrace it and go all the way, or you remain a skeptic
observer on the sideline, waiting for those around you to become agile
before you are willing to commit. Everyone waits for the other one to
become agile, resulting in little or no change at all.</p>
<p>After quietly observing the agile community to see who <em>gets</em>
agile and why, after my own struggles, here is what I’ve noticed the
difference is between those who get it and those who don’t in my search
for improving my own coaching skills.</p>
<h2 id="they-dont-think-they-know-all-the-answers">1. They don’t think
they know all the answers</h2>
<p>Certifications are great. It standardizes knowledge that’s been tried
and tested by thousands. I recommend certifications to everyone. Get as
many as you can.</p>
<p>The problem, however, I personally have with certifications is that
those who earn the “badge” often tends to think they know all the
answers. They stop learning once they’ve received the badge or
certificate and close themselves from alternatives and other approaches.
They often become so attached to the certificate that nothing else is
considered valid.</p>
<p>The result is a lot of things known that has already been done
before, with little exploration to what’s next and what <em>hasn’t</em>
been done yet.</p>
<p>The teams who succeed at agile, with or without the certifications to
go with, are those hungry to continue learning more. They sift hungrily
through everything that comes their way with an <em>open</em> mind, not
indoctrinated with what it <em>should</em> look like. They are open to
possibilities and keep searching, asking more questions as they find
answers to previous questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Successful agile teams have an open mind, looking outside the
existing frameworks and what’s already been answered.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="they-express-their-thoughts-and-feelings-openly">2. They express
their thoughts and feelings openly</h2>
<p>Bare with me on this one. I’m not trying to box anyone into a
category, I’m merely trying to make a point and explain the patterns as
I see them.</p>
<p>Lately, each time I’ve read an agile article that inspires or brings
an a-ha moment rather than merely rephrasing something that’s already
been said a thousand times (which I also enjoy), it’s been from Uruguy
and other Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries. This surprised me,
as the Europeans and North Americans were the leaders in the game until
recently (in my opinion of course).</p>
<p>It got me thinking, and I realized that the difference is the culture
between these demographics, and thus too their approach to learning and
giving feedback. Two essentials in an agile evolution.</p>
<p>Americans, Canadians, Asians and Europeans mostly have a culture of
being <em>nice</em>. In the Asian culture, it’s simply considered rude
not to agree with an authority figure. In the western world, people tend
to care about the other parties’ feelings, not wanting to offend or hurt
or force their opinion onto someone. They’re <em>nice</em>, even though
they don’t agree. They’ll do whatever their boss or Scrum Master asks
from them, even though they might not necessarily agree, as long as the
harmony remains.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the more expressive and outspoken
countries, often speaking Portuguese or Spanish. They are, in terms of
voicing opinions, probably the opposite of the cultures mentioned
above.</p>
<p>These people are loud and they thrive when they can express
themselves. They’re definitely not shy and they question and challenge
the trainer or Scrum Master when they don’t agree or think there’s a
better way. This expression often leads to discomfort in the short run,
but exponential growth in the long run. It’s the questioning that
matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Successful agile teams openly and freely express their thoughts and
feelings, always searching for new ways to do old things.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="they-are-not-afraid-to-engage-in-conflict">3. They are not
afraid to engage in conflict</h2>
<p>Closely linked to the free expression mentioned above, yet distinctly
different and deserving of a separate bullet point, the third and final
differentiator of making agile an inside job is the willingness to
engage in conflict.</p>
<p>When I say conflict, I don’t mean arguing or trying to convince the
other person of your opinion. What I mean is having the courage to stand
up for your beliefs and ideas, even if it means risking unleashing the
dragon or going head first into the eye of the storm.
<strong><em>Without storming, you don’t get to performing as a
team.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a myth and complete fallacy that there can only be one person
right and there must be one person wrong in a conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more healthy form of conflict happens when you look for how both
parties are <em>right,</em> considering a midway that might be something
totally different than either’s initial thoughts or perspective on the
matter. The more information you have, the better decisions you can
make. With this point of view, suddenly conflict becomes a discovery
rather than potential warfare.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Successful agile teams have the courage to engage in conflict and is
willing to be vulnerable in front of their teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Making agile an inside job, rather than waiting for someone
external to make you agile, requires humility, courage, and openness
from each team member.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So my question to you is “What are you waiting for? What’s stopping
you from succeeding at agile?”</p>

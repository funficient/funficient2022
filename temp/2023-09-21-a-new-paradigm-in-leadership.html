    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">A new paradigm in leadership</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>
<p class="date">2019-10-27T11:54:46.360Z</p>
</header>
<p>Leadership has evolved over the years. The old paradigm was much like
a pack of lions. There could be only one alpha male and everyone else
was subordinate to this male. There was a clear hierarchy when it came
to feeding, with the most important eating first and the least important
last. If a member of the pack didn’t abide by the rules the violator was
ostracized from the community. Then left to become either a lone male in
search of another pack or ultimately die.</p>
<p><a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/leadership-and-management/">Leadership
in the industrial age followed much the same model</a>. One CEO at the
top was ultimately responsible for all the decisions. The rest of the
organization is subordinate to this one leader. The hierarchy was also
much the same. There was fierce competition between the pride members to
compete for the alpha male position with the strongest and most cunning
ultimately the winner. When a team member didn’t follow the rules
imposed by the leader, he was fired or in more subtle ways invited to
leave by making the environment so uncomfortable that the only option
was an exit.</p>
<p>The message was quite clear. Either you follow in the footsteps of
the leader, or you leave. It was survival of the fittest in a quest for
more power. The winner takes all.  The lower down the hierarchy, the
less you earned and the less power you had.</p>
<p>It worked well and much got created with this method. Was it not for
the industrial age and the invention of management, much of what we have
today wouldn’t exist. It made cars, books, education, clothes,
furniture, and even money more accessible making many scarce resources
abundant.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-paradigm-of-leadership">A new paradigm of leadership</h2>
<p>But then the world changed with the arrival of the age of the
knowledge worker.  Suddenly, information was the most valued asset and
creative thinking the most sought-after resource.</p>
<p>What worked before doesn’t work anymore. It is becoming increasingly
harder to get results from employees with an approach designed for
laborers who were expected to follow rules. Do not question anything
with quality. The ability to reproduce as many identical objects as fast
as possible and as cheaply as possible. Quality in the age of knowledge
workers is the ability to produce the most unique, new solution to old
problems as fast as possible. Copying what someone else already did is a
recipe for failure whereas previously it was the recipe for success.</p>
<p>A new paradigm of leadership is needed. A paradigm where an
environment for creative thinking and collaboration is possible, where
people can produce unique solutions and learn as fast as possible. An
environment where the knowledge of the group is more valuable than the
knowledge of one.  Where more of the same was valuable before, now more
of what’s new and different is valuable.</p>
<h2 id="the-beehive-as-a-leadership-model">The beehive as a leadership
model</h2>
<p>The new paradigm of leadership can be compared to a beehive. The bee
colony is a social species. Its sole purpose is the sustainability of
the environment and the hive, maintaining the balance between nature and
the organism of the hive.  The quest is to live in harmony with the
environment, not overpower and control it.  The goal is to benefit from
the environment and in return give back equally in service, not seeing
how much you can take with giving back as little as possible.</p>
<p>The purpose becomes creation, not consumption.</p>
<h3 id="the-leader-as-visionary">1. The leader as visionary</h3>
<p>In the beehive, the queen bee’s sole responsibility is to produce
more bees. She is ultimately responsible for the existence of the colony
as the only bee in the colony able to lay eggs. She can be considered
the primary caregiver, with the health of her hive her ultimate
goal.</p>
<p>In the age of knowledge workers, the queen bee is not as much the
manager in the same sense as the pack of lions, but rather the
visionary, giving birth to new ideas that will enable the organization
to survive and expand.</p>
<p>In the organization, the queen bee is the person who is the strongest
visionary, not the most dominant personality. It is the Steve Jobs of
Apple who envisioned making technology accessible to everyone and
beautiful at the same time. Also, it is the Larry Page and Sergey Brin
of Google whose aim is to organize the world’s information and make it
accessible and usable to everyone. It is the Arianna Huffington of The
Huffington Post, with her sleep revolution, Thrive and one of the first
media houses to listen to their audience and give them a voice.</p>
<p>The leader is the person with the strongest vision which the
followers believe in, not the most dominant as it was in the lion
pack.</p>
<h3 id="chosen-by-the-people">2. Chosen by the people</h3>
<p>When a queen bee dies, the hive decides who the next queen bee will
be, not the queen bee herself. It is a collective vote from the bottom
up, not a decision made by the leader at the top.</p>
<p>In the new paradigm of leadership, the leader is selected by the
people they serve. The people choose the person they most trust in the
organization to have their best interest at heart and are able to lead
them towards a shared vision everyone believes in.</p>
<p>This implies that each person in the organization has the ability to
rise to become the next leader.  Where previously leadership development
was only available to a hand-picked few, now, everyone should strive to
develop leadership qualities such as responsibility, trust and respect.
Each person in the organization should ultimately be equally equipped to
become a leader themselves when the need arises.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-towards-a-shared-goal">3. Collaboration towards a
shared goal</h3>
<p>The worker bees tend to the queen bee knowing that she is the reason
for their existence.  There is as much benefit to her as there is to
each bee in the colony. There is no competition between the bees, with
each responsible for a different role within the hive. They work
together to sustain the hive’s existence. There are bees cleaning cells.
Bees receive and store nectar and honey. Bees collect the nectar and
honey. And finally, bees who guard the nest and bees who ventilate the
nest. Each bee rotates through each role and is able to switch between
tasks as it is required by the hive, without any hierarchy.</p>
<p>Each bee contributes to the existence of the hive, working
<em>together</em>, not in competition with each other.</p>
<p>In the organization, this means that the silos are broken down and
the layers of management removed to become a flat structure where each
person contributes to the shared vision of the organization by
performing service for the greater good of the organization. There is no
one service that is deemed more important than the rest. Everyone
realizes that each role is needed for the hive to survive.</p>
<h3 id="self-organizing-teams">4. Self-organizing teams</h3>
<p>In a hive, the queen bee isn’t responsible for telling the bees what
they should be doing or where they should be. When the temperature
within the hive rises too much, more worker bees start flapping their
wings to cool it down because they see the need, not because someone
told them to. When more nectar is needed, more worker bees go foraging.
The goal of the hive is to remain in equilibrium.</p>
<p>In the organization, this means <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/09/23/teams-dont-change/">teams
are empowered to react and respond to the changing</a> needs of the
organization as and when it arises. Each team member is willing and able
to help their colleagues, all with a goal to remain in balance. They
aren’t restricted by the rules and roles imposed on them. This means
that everyone has to make decisions and act in the best interest of the
group, without a manager or leader telling them to.</p>
<h3 id="sensing-and-responding">5. Sensing and responding</h3>
<p>In a hive, when conditions change, the hive as a whole reacts to the
change. When there is a danger, they attack without first waiting for
approval from the queen bee or an appointed supervisor. When the hive
gets too cold, they sense this and fewer bees flap their wings,
servicing the hive in another form without first obtaining permission to
change roles.</p>
<p>The hive operates on the principle that the bees who sense disharmony
in the environment respond to it. The rest of the hive follows. When
there is a danger, the first bee who spots the danger attacks, knowing
that the rest of the hive will follow because every bee has the same
goal – survival of the colony.</p>
<p>In the organization, this means that decision-making happens where
the decision is required, not at the top. When a team needs more
resources, they find a way to get more resources. When the customer
needs change, the client-facing person observes and responds to this
need. The rules and products are changed to remain in harmony with the
environment and the balance between offers and customer needs is
maintained.</p>
<p>This requires that each person needs to have the authority to make
decisions. It also means that the group as a whole needs to respond to
the change as one, knowing it’s in the best interest of the
organization, not a competition to become the next queen bee.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-paradigm-in-leadership-is-needed">A New Paradigm In
Leadership Is Needed</h2>
<p>A new paradigm in leadership is needed. A paradigm where each person
in the organization works together in pursuit of a shared vision. A
vision which they believe in and choose to contribute to. It requires
personal leadership development for everyone in the organization, not
only a select few.</p>
<p>Leadership needs to become a less scarce resource in the age of
information. Just like access to cars, education and books became more
accessible resources during the industrial age.</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="a-story-of-discovering-the-power-of-diversity">A story of
discovering the power of diversity</h2>
<p>Diversity has for long been associated only with different cultures,
skin colors and ages. When you have an international team you’re
diverse, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>The time is long over where you can judge culture by looking at
someone’s skin color or heritage. I’ve met a lot of western thinking
Chinese women. Just because they’re Chinese doesn’t meant they fit into
the traditional role associated with Chinese women as subservient and
quiet. I’ve met as many open-minded African white males as I’ve met the
more traditional close-minded ones only interested in rugby and drinking
beer while the women cook in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I’ve met Asians born and bred in America, I’ve met Americans born and
bred in Asia. I’ve met more black people in France than in Africa. I’ve
worked in teams with only locals that were more diverse than some
international teams consisting of a broad range of nationalities.</p>
<p>Skin color, facial features, age and nationality says something about
you, that is undeniable. But it is what goes on in your mind that really
sheds light on the capacity for embracing diversity.</p>
<h2 id="same-same-but-different">Same-same, But Different</h2>
<p>Diversity is about accepting differences. It’s about being open to
listen for understanding, not trying to make someone fit into your mold
of what you perceive to be “<em>good”</em> behavior.</p>
<p>For example, in most of the western world, it is considered good
manners when a man holds the door and allows the woman to enter first.
In Africa, however, it is considered to be cowardly as it is the role of
the man to protect the woman. By walking into a door first, they can
make sure that the room is safe of wild animals or ‘tsotsi’s’ before
allowing the woman enter. They also have a culture where speaking loud
enough for everyone to hear means that you have nothing to hide and it
means you are not gossiping —considered a <em>good</em> trait. In the
western world, it is often seen as rude and selfish.</p>
<p>In the western world, being able to respond immediately and say no in
a meeting is valued as strong leadership skills. In Asia, saying
<em>no</em> to a superior is perceived as rude and disrespectful.</p>
<p>We have different rules depending on the geographic location, the
industry, even the team. Diversity naturally happens when we play
embracing all these different rules rather than for one set of rules to
dominate.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-diversity">Embracing Diversity</h2>
<p>The key to embracing diversity is to find people who are willing to
step outside of their comfort zone and be open to different ways of
thinking.</p>
<p>You can have a more diverse team by putting different roles together
than different nationalities as I learned one day by stepping outside my
comfort zone attending a coding retreat as the only non-coder in the
room. Luckily for me, they included and embraced me for being different.
During the course of the day, our collaboration improved as we
understood each other a little better.</p>
<p>The first insight surfacing after a first round of coding was how
different a tester thinks than a developer and how this can be
beneficial. The typical developer is very detail oriented and has an
analytical mind. He can spend hours zooming into the intricacies of one
function while keeping his focus. I, on the other hand, am a big-picture
thinker. I never liked programming simply because it distracted me too
much from what I’m naturally good at, namely keeping the big picture in
mind. It’s not that I can’t program, it’s that I find it hard to keep my
attention on the details when what I really want to do is see the whole.
Suddenly, the typical developer-vs-tester competitive relationship
turned to a valuable partnership.</p>
<p>Another insight surfaced when another developer, for the first time,
realized the importance of using proper naming conventions to describe
objects. The trainer and other coders have complained about this
specific developer many times before as he uses generic naming
conventions only understandable to him and refuses to change, not seeing
the need. I, however, sat next to him and asked him what he thought
should be obvious. It seems to me that for the first time it dawned on
him how being a developer doesn’t guarantee that you know what is going
on inside his mind. He changed the naming convention without any
objection to something more meaningful. X1 changed to CustomerAge and X2
changed to NumberOfCustomers. For the first time he understood, but it
took someone being different to show the reason.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><em>To get a more diverse team, stop looking at different
nationalities. Embrace and include different roles and functions in the
team and create an environment of understanding and empathy.</em></p>
<p>As apposed to only doing pair programming with two or more
developers, consider including occasional pair sessions including
different roles. Let the product owner or the tester or the designer
spend a few hours with the developer and vice versa.</p>
<p>What will surface is a better understanding of the different needs
and compassion for the pain points of the other team members. It will
mean better collaboration and better products.</p>

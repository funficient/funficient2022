<h1 class="title">What’s your leadership style?</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>
<p class="date">2019-01-28T13:36:28.932Z</p>
</header>
<p>We live in an age of abundance.  We have more resources accessible to
us than ever before.  Where previously knowledge and education were only
for a select few, now everyone has access to ivy league universities and
online libraries. Want to know how to do anything?  Just Google it.</p>
<p>With the internet and industrialization, everyone, even in remote
African villages, has access to most goods and services.   Want it? 
Order it on Amazon.  With the rise of green energy and renewable
resources, the scarcity of fossil fuel energy sources suddenly poses
less of a threat.</p>
<p>Yet, leadership is still only accessible to the top 1% of most
organizations. Even though the drive for autonomous teams is on the
increase.</p>
<p>Where during the industrial revolution the focus was on making
<em>resources</em> accessible to everyone, in the information revolution
and the age of knowledge workers, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/01/08/comprehensive-overview-of-leadership/">leadership
is the resource we need to develop</a> and make more accessible. The <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/05/25/effective-leadership-style/">evolution
of leadership styles</a> reflects this need.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-colour">What’s your colour?</h2>
<p>In his groundbreaking book called <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/reinventing-organizations-a0babc967488">Reinventing
Organizations</a>, Frederic Laloux compared the development of
organizations to childhood development. Each new paradigm of
organizational growth is associated with a specific colour and requires
a different leadership style.  At the lowest end of the spectrum is the
oldest magic magenta and impulsive red paradigms, where organizations
were tribal and the survival of a group was a result of its leader.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image of organizational
development</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Organizations operating from a red paradigm are typically driven by
fear and can be compared to a mafia gang.  The following stages of
organizational development, as it progresses through amber, orange,
green and finally teal, each add certain valuable characteristics to
organizational development, and with that changes to leadership
styles.</p>
<p>The preceding paradigm is not worse than the following, just like a
toddler is not better than an infant.  It is merely different stages of
development, each adding something unique and even necessary.</p>
<p>Orange, for example, adds the repeatability of processes and roles
and introduces meritocracy, where leadership is no longer associated
with royalty, but with skill and worthiness.  Teal, the most evolved or
mature organization, has a leadership style with shared decision-making
and coaching rather than the authoritarian style of a red organization. 
For the organization to evolve, the leadership style needs to
evolve.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-different-leadership-styles">Comparing different
leadership styles</h2>
<p>Just like each organizational development style brings different
benefits to an organization, each requires a different leadership
style.  The one is not better than the next, it is just more suitable as
the primary leadership style in the organization.  A good leader,
however, can switch between any of these leadership styles.</p>
<p>There are many different types of leadership styles and a Google
search reveals more styles than what can be included in one post, many
of them very similar.  This post focuses mainly on three of these
styles.</p>
<h3 id="authoritarian-leadership">Authoritarian leadership</h3>
<figure>
<img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/leadership-styles-compared-funficient-300x259.jpg"
alt="leadership-styles-compared-funficient" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">leadership-styles-compared-funficient</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>Authoritarian Leadership</strong> style. Familiar to many
of us in larger organizations. It is characterized by close supervision,
control, and a lack of input from the team.  This style of leadership is
suitable for amber organizations.  <strong>Transactional
leadership.</strong>  This is the typical micro-manager style. It is
closely associated with this leadership style and is more suitable in an
organization operating from an orange paradigm.  Here power is closely
controlled by the main decision-maker or CEO. Information flows
downstream only on a need-to-know basis.  The keywords for this style of
leadership are dictator, strict, and rigid.</p>
<h3 id="servant-leadership">Servant leadership</h3>
<p><strong>Servant Leadership,</strong> compared to Authoritarian
Leadership, introduces more freedom and distributed decision-making.  
This leadership style allows people to make decisions and self-organize
— two very necessary ingredients for autonomous teams.  The keywords for
this type of leadership are humble, caring and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Servant Leadership essentially focuses on solving problems and
removing stumbling blocks to help the team be more productive. <em>It’s
about protection.</em> </p>
<p>This leadership style can be compared to nurturing the golden goose,
creating an optimum environment for the goose to lay its golden eggs.
The golden goose (or rather geese) are the team members. The people who
actively build and put into reality what is dreamed up by Business and
Marketing.</p>
<p>Compared to all the other leadership styles, this style is about
service and helping the team.  It is focused on the followers.</p>
<h3 id="transformational-leadership">Transformational leadership</h3>
<p><strong>Transformational Leadership</strong>, however, doesn’t merely
nurture the golden goose, it is a breeding farm producing golden geese.
This leadership style focuses on developing problem <em>solvers,</em> 
not merely solving problems.  This evolutionary style of leadership
makes leadership accessible to everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2017/02/02/transformational-leaders/">Transformational
leaders</a> create more leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many similarities between Servant Leadership and
Transformational Leadership. Both these leadership styles put the needs
of others ahead of their own and both share decision-making power, which
is necessary for organizations operating from a green and teal
paradigm.</p>
<p>The main <em>difference</em> between these two leadership styles is
the focus of the leader. The Servant Leader’s primary focus is on his
followers whereas the Transformational Leader’s primary focus is on the
organization. Where the Servant Leader makes sure that the followers can
do their job, the Transformational Leader focuses on bringing out the
best in each follower.</p>
<p>Transformational Leaders help followers grow, while Servant Leaders
simply remove barriers to growth, without intentionally influencing the
growth of the individual.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-transformational-leadership">Benefits of
Transformational Leadership</h2>
<p>Each leadership style has benefits and each is valuable in a given
situation. The leader must discern which style to use in a specific
situation.  Transformational Leadership, characterized by passion and
inspiration, includes the following benefits:</p>
<h3 id="influence-behaviour">1. Influence behaviour</h3>
<p>Whereas with Authoritarian Leadership change is extrinsically
motivated, such as monetary bonuses, gifts and other carrot-and-stick
methods of motivation, making it a short-lived resource,
Transformational Leadership uses <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/12/10/intrinsic-motivation/">intrinsic
motivators</a> to inspire change.</p>
<p>The leader never tells the people what to do, rather, they offer to
do things for the leader <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/01/04/inspirational-leaders/">because
the leader inspires them</a> so much that they want to serve them and
want to help them reach their goals.</p>
<p>It’s obvious why this is an extremely useful leadership style to
develop as it frees up the leader from being the strict parent to the
visionary and enabler.</p>
<h3 id="more-sustainable-change">2. More sustainable change</h3>
<p>More change initiatives fail than not. Fact.</p>
<p>The reason why it fails is that in an authoritarian (or
transactional) leadership style environment, people will obey the rules
enforced on them. Not necessarily because they believe in it, but
because it will keep them safe from harm (such as getting fired). The
moment the change initiative is over though, or less focus is placed on
it, people tend to quickly return to their old patterns and
behaviours.</p>
<p>With Transformational Leadership, however, the change is sustainable
as the leader motivates the employees to do things simply because
<em>it’s the right thing to do,</em> with the focus on a cause bigger
than one person. By empowering people to make decisions and putting a
decision-making process in place, they end up making decisions that are
best for their team and the organization as a whole, as the focus is
always an evolutionary vision or purpose, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">closely
associated with organizations operating from a teal</a> paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="empowered-teams-exceed-expectations">3. Empowered teams exceed
expectations</h3>
<p>Transformational leadership, with its inherent capacity to empower
teams, serves as a primary catalyst for team members to excel. Instead
of requiring supervision, these highly motivated individuals leave the
leader free to strategize and focus on expansion, no longer burdened by
the need to manage resources. This proactive approach ultimately sets
the team up to surpass expectations.</p>
<p>At the core of human nature, people yearn to be acknowledged as
proficient. In certain work cultures, this recognition comes at the
expense of others, painting them in a negative light to make oneself
appear superior – a strategy that hardly ever pays off. On the other
hand, in a more progressive and mature work culture, individuals
willingly go above and beyond to solve problems, driven by the potential
to stand out.</p>
<p>As we transition to a team where everyone is encouraged to be their
best self, while striving towards a common goal, the outcome is
remarkable. The collective success achieved through this team-oriented
approach considerably outshines what a single individual’s concept of
success could ever yield.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-leadership">The need for leadership</h2>
<p>Today, more than ever before, we need to make leadership more
accessible.  No longer can companies afford to spend their most
expensive resources managing other resources, ultimately slowing down
the productivity of the entire organization.  To stay ahead of the
competition, you need to create more leaders.</p>
<p>Leadership is about <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2017/03/05/redefining-ownership-age-agile/">ownership</a>. 
It’s about responsibility. Also, it’s about building <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/08/18/5-ways-build-culture-of-trust/">trust</a>
and earning respect.</p>
<p>It’s about being the best version that you can b. Whether you are a
parent, a postman, or the CEO of a large corporation.  <em>What is your
leadership style?</em></p>

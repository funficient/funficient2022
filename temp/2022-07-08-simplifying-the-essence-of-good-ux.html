products and services that delights</h2>
<p>The process of user experience design can get complicated and
involved and somewhat confusing. However, the essence of a good user
experience is quite simple. This post outlines the three most important
elements of a good user experience.</p>
<p>There are of course other foundational elements to user experience
design that remains valid, like knowing who your target user is, problem
framing etc. However, this post focuses on the <em>user journey -</em>
or process flow and key UI elements - assuming you know your user and
their specific goals when interacting with your product.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="provide-context">1. Provide context</h2>
<p>Imagine, just for a moment, being blindfolded and dropped in the
middle of a busy city you’ve never been to before. What do you feel when
you open your eyes after the blindfold has been removed?</p>
<p>Most people will be anxious and overwhelmed, not knowing where they
are or which direction to take next. That is how new users also often
feel when they land on a website or app they’re not familiar with. It
can feel so overwhelming that many visitors will simply close the app
and go back to one they are familiar with.</p>
<p>One of the most important elements of a good user experience is
providing context. It is rather like having access to a map with markers
showing you where you are and clear directions of how to get to where
you want to be.</p>
<p>Some examples of this include the mini-map in the bottom left corner
of <a href="https://conceptboard.com/">Conceptboard</a> which allows you
to zoom into one section on the board, while still being able to see
where you are in relation to the rest of the contents.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*CL8GUMszLPuGLAGMZWLn1A.png" /></p>
<p>Above you can see a thumbnail of the entire board in the left bottom
corner, with the section currently displayed in my view port outlined
with a blue border on this thumbnail image.</p>
<p>Thus, if I want to go to the start of the content, I roughly know how
much I should move and in which direction.</p>
<p>YouTube, which most people will be familiar with, does it
differently, yet, the concept remains the same. All the important
information that will tell you where you are in relation to your YouTube
subscription are displayed on the first page.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9ovyX4o4zIDHb4wpn1fe0g.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see above, I can immediately see who is logged in, any
notifications, and then whether or not there’s new content or live
broadcasts for any of my favorite channels. Having this information
available at a glance can save me from scrolling searching for new
content from the home page.</p>
<p>Another, more common, example of context is the use of dashboards.
Dashboards contain only a summary of the most important statistics to
give you an overview of the status of any product, process, or
organization. It contextualizes the most important elements that will
allow you to focus on the most productive area.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IYe5CDHetM6WSq45tJ6hxw.jpeg" /></p>
<p>For example, if the dashboard shows that the current traffic is busy,
you might decide to take a bicycle, or wait a while before getting into
your car.</p>
<p>By providing a birds-eye-view of a larger, more complex product or
system, you can easily navigate and make better decisions, which makes
you feel more in control. And ultimately, the best user experience is
one where you always feel that you’re in control.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-as-efficient-as-possible">2. Make it as efficient as
possible</h2>
<p>Apple mastered efficiency with its focus on simplicity. It’s easy to
add just one more feature or button or step in a process. It’s hard to
remove clutter and reduce a workflow to the absolute minimum amount of
steps.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NCNHxNMzvErJ3emqCqltvQ.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Apple managed to reduce the number of buttons on its devices so that
it’s close to impossible to press the wrong button or wonder which one
to select to get the desired outcome. They also reduced the number of
available apps which makes it so much easier to find one you are looking
for rather than spend hours filtering through all the available apps on
the Google Play Store for example, never quite knowing what you are
getting.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of steps, interactions, and options to choose
from reduces cognitive load and overwhelm. It makes it easier to get to
your desired destination, and it makes it harder to accidentally do
anything wrong in the process.</p>
<p>Another good example of efficiency is the famous Amazon one-click
checkout where they aim to reduce the human interaction to complete an
online purchase to a single click.</p>
<p>A good user experience spends a lot of time on streamlining the
processes and steps within a process to be as efficient as possible.
It’s about simplicity and clarity. Looking at the map metaphor in the
previous point, efficiency is rather like having Google Maps direct you
to your destination. It calculates the shortest route based on your
preferred mode of transport and clearly guides you throughout your
journey.</p>
<p>An efficient user experience is like drawing a map to direct an alien
to the nearest coffee shop. You can’t assume anything and can’t
communicate using words, as an alien might not understand our language.
Rather, communication is visual, highlighting only the most important
landmarks on the way and clear directions towards your destination.</p>
<p>Efficiency is about simplicity and speed. How fast and how easily can
you get from where you are to where you want to be?</p>
<h2 id="be-proactive-not-reactive">3. Be proactive, not reactive</h2>
<p>The third and final element of a good user experience is pre-empting
a user’s next step and making it as easy and obvious as possible. It’s
rather like the emergency exit pointers in an airplane that lights up
when there’s an emergency. You might not see the destination, but you
have no doubt as to what the next step is.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7P2QFLvl33wiYfj-Zp9JsA.jpeg" /></p>
<p>A good user experience is one where you don’t have to stop and ask
for help while already on your journey. Rather, your questions are
pre-empted as they arise and answered <em>before</em> you have to ask
for help.</p>
<p>Many user experiences expect that you should learn all the
information required for your entire journey before you start.
Onboarding requires you to complete a tutorial of features you might
never use or need before you have even decided whether this is the app
for you. Once completed, your one chance of accessing this information
is over and you’re on your own having to figure out how and where things
are when you need them.</p>
<p>A good user experience, on the other hand, is one where you get
just-in-time information throughout your journey in small increments. It
doesn’t tell you everything you might need, it tells you the most
important things you have to know in order to successfully complete the
next step of your journey.</p>
<p>An excellent example of this concept can be seen from a local air
carrier called <a href="https://www.flysafair.co.za/">FlySAFair</a>. A
day before your flight you receive an email with a checklist of
everything you need to do before your flight.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1298/1*7SnXfXaAsFaF7WgtC-H9LQ.png" /></p>
<p>They send this information just in time for you to have the highest
probability of having an easy, smooth flight. If they sent the
information too early you might forget. Rather, they send it just you
need to check-in.</p>
<p>This is probably the best example of pre-empting the next step in the
user experience so I’ll leave it at that. The essence of this element is
to think one step ahead of the user and give them all the information
they might need in order to just complete that one step.</p>
<h1 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h1>
<p>When I think of a really good user experience, I think of the IKEA
experience.</p>
<p>From the moment you enter an IKEA store you are guided in a one-way
direction throughout the store, with shortcuts and openings at strategic
places to cater for people looking for something specific. You always
know exactly where you are and there’s no chance of getting lost or
going in the wrong direction. This frees your active memory to allow you
to focus on enjoying the shopping experience, rather than figuring out
where you are or where you want to go.</p>
<p>Each section adds context with inspiration corners showing you how to
put different elements within the store together. There isn’t just
sofa’s, there are sofa’s with scatter cushions, throws, candle’s, side
tables, mugs, plants and more. The bedroom area doesn’t just display
beds, there are also soft finishes like curtains, bedding and lamps.
They show you how to use different products by displaying it throughout
the store.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*J0UJe0lEc8ukLVNmsjN7Xg.jpeg" /></p>
<p>What I love most about the IKEA concept is that it doesn’t expect you
to make up your mind before you’ve gone through the entire store. There
are notepads and pencils at strategic points for you to make notes as
you stroll through each section. Only at the end of the store are you
asked to make a final decision by selecting the items you saw in the
display area from the warehouse. This means there is time for ideas to
develop in your mind, and it also means you don’t have to walk through
the entire store with bulky or difficult to carry items.</p>
<p>There is adequate context with a comprehensive store where you know
you can literally get everything you need and want to furnish an entire
home — all in one place. All you have to do is follow the path laid out
in front of you.</p>
<p>The journey is efficient, wasting no effort in walking up and down
different aisles searching for something as everything is
one-directional, but with shortcuts for the seasoned IKEA’er.</p>
<p>Information is given just-in-time as you need it with strategically
placed display corners and information booths. There is also a cafeteria
area just when you start to get tired, as if they knew this is where
people need to stop for a coffee and local Swedish delicatessens.
Everything is designed to give information just one step ahead of where
you currently are, making it pro-active.</p>
<p>Putting all these elements together, plus of course the quality and
innovative design of the products, make shopping at IKEA a pleasurable
experience.</p>

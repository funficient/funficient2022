    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="book-review"><em>Book review</em></h2>
<p><em>An analysis of what makes things go viral. The book breaks down
the core elements of change by looking at a diverse set of case studies,
including the revival of Hush Puppies in 1996, the reduction of murders
in New York by 64% over 5 years, the success of Sesame Street, and more.
It is an insightful read that describes the various factors required for
tipping point change.</em></p>
<h1 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h1>
<p>The book is a must-read for anyone interested in growing their
product and services, or creating sustainable and impactful change in
any area.</p>
<p>The book and case studies are industry agnostic and draw on lessons
from diverse examples to describe what causes pandemic-type change, thus
will resonate with most people interested in change.</p>
<h1 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h1>
<p>Each chapter analyzes one of the three core factors that result in
pandemic style change. It starts off with outlining the characteristics
of a virus and comparing it to a few case studies to find a
correlation.</p>
<p>According to the author, the main characteristics of a virus
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is contagious</li>
<li>Little causes have big effects</li>
<li>Change happens at one, dramatic moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this understanding of pandemic like change, he the delves into
a number of case studies to find the correlation between change and the
spread of viruses.</p>
<p>One case study outlines how Hush Puppies was on a sure decline prior
to 1994 when they sold only 30 000 pairs of shoes per year. Yet, a mere
2 years later they sold four times that number in an unexpected turn of
events. At the heart of this turn-around were 2 teenagers who started
wearing old pairs of Hush Puppies as a form of self-expression and
because no one else was wearing them.</p>
<p>In virus terms, these two teenagers would be the equivalent of
patient 0 and forms one of the three agents of change, namely
<strong><em>the Law of the Few</em></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-law-of-the-few">The Law of the Few</h2>
<p>According to the analysis, there are only a few key people needed to
result in big change. These few people are, however, special kinds of
people, namely <strong><em>connectors</em></strong>,
<strong><em>mavens</em></strong> and
<strong><em>salesmen</em></strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>connector</em></strong> is what can be best compared to
an influencer . A connector knows a lot of people from diverse areas and
expertise. They also keep contact with all these people in the form of
<em>weak</em> social connections. They might only send a Christmas card
once a year, or remember a birthday, but they keep the connection to
these people outside their inner circle of close friends. They are also
different from the average person in that they reach out to people
outside this inner circle of friends.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>maven</em></strong> can be described as ‘one who
collects knowledge’. These are the Warren Buffets of change — those
people who track trends and information obsessively to allow them to
spot trends and early movements in the market. They also, however,
really <em>want</em> to share this information and help others without
expecting anything in return.</p>
<p><strong><em>Salesmen</em></strong> are the persuaders that change
people’s minds on a topic. Their arguments are logical and appropriate
and they are naturally attuned to people.</p>
<p>When you combine these three types of people, it can result in a
tipping point.</p>
<h2 id="the-stickiness-factor">The Stickiness Factor</h2>
<p>The next core agent of change Malcolm Gladwell calls <strong><em>the
Stickiness Factor —</em></strong> that something that makes something
memorable.</p>
<p>The Stickiness Factor is described with use cases from <em>Sesame
Street</em> and <em>Blues Clues —</em> another successful children’s
educational program.</p>
<p>Some of the insights that explain what makes something sticky or
memorable shared in these chapters include making the audience
participants; having a structure that introduces increasing levels of
complexity in a specific sequence; and repeating the same
information.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-context">The Power of Context</h2>
<p>The Power of Context, which is the third and final agent of change is
described with a rather disturbing story of a woman who was murdered
while more than 30 of her close neighbours heard her screams for help
without anyone calling authorities.</p>
<p>Wanting to understand this phenomenon and why no-one responded to her
cries for help, a scientific experiment was run. The finding was that
when people are in a group responsibility for acting is diffused as
everyone assumes someone else will act, resulting in no-one acting.</p>
<p>Another case study explaining the power of the environment in
supporting change is the fight against crime in New York. At the time
New York was filled with petty crimes and murders, with public transport
being a breeding ground for these crimes.</p>
<p>The tipping point that turned around these statistics started simply
by cleaning up graffiti from all the trains one line at a time. The
graffiti was obviously not the most serious crime to go after, but it
was the symbol in the environment that indicated that there is no
effective law enforcement. Cleaning up the graffiti one line at a time
was like claiming back authority.</p>
<p>The main insight shared about the power of context is that living in
a good neighbourhood with a bad family is better than living in a bad
neighbourhood with a good family. Environment influences behaviour.</p>
<p>Another key factor the author points out related to behavior is our
ability to perceive the external environment around us. In an experiment
with theology students evaluating whether someone will be a good
Samaritan or not, the primary indicator turned out whether someone is in
a hurry or relaxed.</p>
<p>When the students were told they are late for an appointment the
majority passed a person in need without stopping to help. The majority
of the students who were told they are early on the way to the
appointment stopped and helped the person in need.</p>
<p>The book is filled with many more insights, but these were the key
takeaways I got from it.</p>
<h1 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h1>
<p>The book is an easy and interesting read, written in a conversational
style.</p>
<p>The different stories and diverse case studies backed by scientific
research help broaden the understanding of the core concepts and adds to
the credibility of the information.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-author">About the author</h1>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell is a Canadian journalist and writer who has written
for The New Yorker, The Washington Post and more before authoring the
first of one of his many bestselling books, including Blink and
Outliers.</p>
<p>He uniquely blends the more intellectual science with a popular
reading style that is accessible to non-scientific people, bridging the
gap between science and popular knowledge.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Tipping point contains a number of practical stories based on
relatable products and services, making it a valuable intersection
between the theory and practice of change.</p>
<p>The book analyses the main factors needed to reach tipping point and
include a number of insights that can help anyone enable change in
whatever shape or form is most beneficial to them. The vastly different
case studies enable the reader to understand the underlying mechanics of
change.</p>
<p>A highly recommended read for anyone interested in change of any
kind.</p>

<h2 id="an-inclusive-approach-to-more-agile-workplaces">An inclusive
approach to more agile workplaces</h2>
<p>Nearly two years after the great pandemic of 2020, the world will
never again return to the old normal. Remote work is here to stay and
your options are either to offer fully remote, or risk losing valuable
talent.</p>
<p>Most people are of the opinion that hybrid doesn’t work. But most
people also said cars would never become a thing while horses and carts
were the norm. Yet, the undeniable value of the improved mode of
transport replaced horse and cart completely.</p>
<h2 id="free-to-choose">Free to choose</h2>
<p>I believe that remote work, or at least hybrid, will become the norm
— pandemic or no pandemic. It’s no longer about staying safe. It is
about freedom of choice. Freedom to choose talent across geographic
regions previously restricted, and freedom to choose where and when to
work regardless of where you physically are. It’s about coming together,
inclusion, breaking down borders and barriers.</p>
<p>Hybrid alternatives to work is the next step to embrace this freedom
of choice.</p>
<p>Sure, it is challenging, just as going fully remote was challenging
at first. But it’s not an insurmountable problem. I actually think it’s
a much easier problem to solve than going fully remote.</p>
<h1 id="pros-and-cons-of-hybrid">Pro’s and Con’s of hybrid</h1>
<p>You don’t use a hammer for everything, so why would you choose one
communication preference for everything?</p>
<p>Like anything in life, there’s benefits and disadvantages to all
options. The disadvantage of a fully co-located team is that the commute
to the location can take up a lot of time and add unnecessary stress to
an already stressed resource which negatively affects the
productivity.</p>
<p>The advantage is that face-to-face communication is by far the most
effective form of communication. It allows for clearer communication and
a more nuanced interpretation of a message and it makes it much easier
for groups to have a natural conversation.</p>
<p>But you don’t always need face-to-face communication. Sometimes it’s
more effective to send an email or a text message. Other times a voice
note is more than enough. And hybrid is offering the best of both
worlds, which makes it (in my opinion) an even better alternative than
100% face-to-face.</p>
<p>For some of the benefits of hybrids, read <a
href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/funficient/embracing-hybrid-the-speed-buddy-warmer-723758">Embracing
Hybrid | The Speed Buddy warmer</a>, where I drill into a hybrid game
design and list some of the benefits of this approach and why it is
engaging.</p>
<h2 id="fishing-for-gold">Fishing for gold</h2>
<p>A common technique in workshop facilitation is called the <a
href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/teaching-strategies/fishbowl">fishbowl
technique</a>. A larger group is broken into two smaller parts, one
actively participating, while the other observes.</p>
<p>This technique is also common in design thinking where the <a
href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/">empathy map</a>
is used to help designers become more objective by focusing on the
actual behaviors they observe rather than their interpretation filtered
by personal biases.</p>
<p>A hybrid environment naturally supports this technique, breaking the
group into two smaller sections already. Consciously using this
technique could be an easy entry into hybrid meetings.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-to-engagement">The key to engagement</h2>
<p>Whether a meeting is in person, remote or hybrid has nothing to do
how engaging the session is. Engagement requires active participation.
Any meeting where one person takes up all the airtime to simply convey
their ideas are boring. A meeting becomes engaging when each participant
has a role.</p>
<p>The only thing you as facilitator should focus on is to ensure that
everyone is given a role explicitly. There are of course a lot of other
things that can enhance the level of engagement, but the most essential
ingredient for engagement is participation.</p>
<p>This was one of the key success factors in a recent (successful)
experiment we co-created in a hybrid environment, which resulted in
something I call the <a
href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/funficient/embracing-hybrid-the-speed-buddy-warmer-723758">Speed
Buddy Warmer</a>.</p>
<h1 id="speed-buddy-warmer-a-hybrid-design">Speed Buddy Warmer — A
Hybrid Design</h1>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/funficient/embracing-hybrid-the-speed-buddy-warmer-723758">speed
buddy warmer</a> is a very simple tool to include everyone, give
everyone an opportunity to connect, and give each participant
responsibility.</p>
<p>Based on the scuba dive buddy concept, the speed buddy warmer matches
online and in-person participants as buddies for the duration of the
meeting. These buddies share a unique hand sign to ensure that everyone
is included at all times.</p>
<p>It often happens (especially in a remote setting) that the
facilitator can only see a handful of the participants on their screen,
making it hard to notice disengagement, questions or other issues. I
know I for one have sat in remote meetings what felt like forever with
my hand raised waiting for the facilitator to notice me and allow me
time to ask my question.</p>
<p>The Speed Buddy Warmer links the two environments and dedicate people
in pairs to ensure their buddy is always looked after during the session
and never overlooked.</p>
<p>Without any preparation, this game can be used for new teams and
teams familiar with each other. For more details on how to play it, as
well as a deeper dive into it’s design, read my post called <a
href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/funficient/embracing-hybrid-the-speed-buddy-warmer-723758">Embracing
Hybrid | The Speed Buddy warmer</a>.</p>
<p>We designed the game in a few minutes, and it proved to be easy
enough and effective to engage both remote and in-person people.</p>
<p>So next time someone says hybrid doesn’t work, think again. Maybe
you’re just doing it wrong.</p>

<p><em>A story of testing and why it is important</em></p>
<p>I accidentally stumbled into the world of testing. I had no clue what
is was at the time, yet my first job title after I dropped out of
University was <strong>test engineer</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn’t really care what my job title was or what I did to be
honest. All I cared about was getting <strong><em>a</em></strong> job in
order for me to not have to go back to the much-too-small hometown where
I grew up, where big dreams were not allowed.</p>
<p>So when my friend said their company was looking for someone, I went
for an interview and two weeks later started. Perfect! A job that will
allow me to stay in the city, with the added benefit of having lunch
with my best friend everyday. Life couldn’t get any better.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innocent inquiries…</em></strong></p>
<p>But soon friends started asking me what I did, and I realized I
couldn’t really answer satisfactorily, so looked at my appointment
letter to figure out what I’m supposed to answer. I understood the words
written on the paper, but I didn’t understand what they entailed, so I
innocently walked to my boss and asked him what it meant to be a test
engineer. He chuckled, me not understanding why, and continued to
patiently explain in lay men’s terms what I do every day, leaving him
very amused and me blissfully satisfied, knowing what I am finally.</p>
<p>Equipped with this knowledge, I felt more important, more confident,
and did my best to be the best test engineer ever, even though I really
still didn’t have a clue what I was doing — only following instructions
blindly.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>With the same oblivion I continued my early career stumbling on
different job titles as jobs managed to easily fall into my lap unasked
for, allowing me to do the things I love while earning a salary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each time I got a new job I followed the same approach. I
contemplated exactly what it meant to be this new job title, and what
you would need to become the best at it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, quite a useful and sensible approach! At the time
though I was considered much the opposite of sensible. To this day this
logic approach seems to be considered weird by most. I find it weird
that more people don’t figure out what they’re supposed to be doing
before they start doing it. But hey, each for their own.</p>
<p>My journey included, among other roles, that of being a test
engineer, quality assurance consultant — including automation-,
usability-, manual- and performance testing — , test manager and finally
quality manager. Each time, treating the role as if it was a blank
canvas, I invested great effort in researching what each role really
personified, and the goal of each.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I studied each role from all the possible angles, and each time would
pride myself in mastering it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a test engineer I learned that the only way to verify that
something is working, was to be very sure that you understand what it is
supposed to be doing and why.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sensible standards…</em></strong></p>
<p>I came to understand the importance and value of standards,
especially international standards, and how to systematically work my
way through a standard, evaluating software (in this case gaming
machines and systems) from all the possible angles — reviewing the
source code, the artwork, the physical device, and that everything works
well together.</p>
<p>Then, one step up as a quality assurance consultant, I learned that
you don’t need a standard to test something, and learned about different
requirement gathering techniques.</p>
<p><strong><em>Very virtuous…</em></strong></p>
<p>I then discovered the <strong>V-model</strong> and analyzed it’s
meaning on each side of the “V” in detail, having countless arguments
about the difference between verification and validation and each level
of the model and what it means.</p>
<p>I learned about all the different test techniques and which to apply
when. I also learned about how and when to use harnesses and data.
<em>Most interestingly, I learned that depending on your viewpoint,
everyone in the numerous arguments were in actual fact correct.</em>
System testing to one means the same as unit testing to someone else.
Integration testing to the developer means something different to the
architect or the business owner.</p>
<p>I also learned about things like code coverage tools and the
difference between stress testing, performance testing, and how to
implement a test automation framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>World without end…</em></strong></p>
<p>When I was appointed as quality manager, I was surprised to find out
that what I thought was the totality of the world of testing, was merely
one drop in the ocean and that there was much more to learn. As testing
only forms a small part of quality assurance, so quality assurance is
also only a small part of quality management.</p>
<p>As I taught all the new employees on the ISO 9000 framework, I
learned that quality is not about how fast, or how good, or how
beautiful a system is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quality is simply meeting customer expectations, fulfilling a need,
solving a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not quality if you give someone looking for a fuel efficient,
small car to use in the city, an expensive Lamborghini. <em>Bigger,
fancier, more is <strong>never</strong> better.</em></p>
<p>It’s quality only if you listen to the customer and give them what
they want. It’s quality if you make decisions in collaboration with the
customer, not telling — or worse, building — them what you think they
need, based on advice from your best developer.</p>
<p>It’s also not necessarily about giving them what they ask for, as
mostly they are using the wrong terms or examples and is simply trying
to be understood. Rather, they are looking at you to advise them on what
they need.</p>
<p><em>As this knowledge dawned on me, I realized that I’ve been putting
way too much emphasis on the functionality and technical capabilities,
and way too little on finding out what the user needs or what their
problems are.</em></p>
<p>I changed my approach and I was overwhelmed with how many customers
thanked me for helping them do their job easier, better!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tested less, yet the quality went up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And just as I thought I had all the answers, they went and changed
all the questions. <em>Agile was born.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>Suddenly, my safe little island where I was the queen of my world,
collapsed as we were pushed into a team where the world evolved around
only the developers and their needs, with the testers the scapegoats
having to take responsibility for all the errors right at the end of the
development cycle.</p>
<p>While the developers had the luxury of “developing” at ease until the
deadline, the testers had to make magic happen as the developers have
already used up more than the allowed for time buffer.</p>
<p>To make this worse, they didn’t really seem to think that testers are
needed at all and only saw them as an annoyance, hurting their sensitive
ego’s each time a bug was reported. Something they would <em>much</em>
rather do without. Understandably.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t hard enough, we — the testers — were outnumbered by
far with ratios as much as 8 developers to 1 tester in a team. With most
agile coaches and Scrum Masters coming from a developer background, they
never really understood the art of testing, and focused only on the
technical skills, making the life of an agile tester less than a happy
one.</p>
<p>The developers started learning skills like TDD (test driven
development) and with the Product Owner giving the acceptance criteria,
slowly but surely the testers were shifted out of the development life
cycle, seen as waste by the ever ambitious line managers looking to
optimize the process.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be seen as redundant, I worked hard to master what I
call agile testing.</p>
<p>I experimented with exploratory test methods, and spent more time
with the developers. I had handover sessions with them to understand
what they have included in their unit tests already, thus lessening my
work load, and understanding the architecture of what they have built,
to optimize my effort. I also spent more time with the automation team
who couldn’t keep up with the speed, compiling regression test suits
that covers all the functions, without having to test everything.</p>
<p>And it worked!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I figured out that agile testing means better team communication,
better judgement, and happier teams as the effort was split more
equally.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h2>
<p>However, as the test and development team started to deliver higher
quality work, the next problem became evident, namely the requirements.
Or rather, the lack of customer-centered requirements. I realized that
having a user story doesn’t mean the person that wrote it understands
the user it is intended for.</p>
<p>The struggle started all over again, this time trying to get buy-in
and understanding not from the developers as to the value of testing,
but the Product Owners and business.</p>
<p>Finally, however, I admitted defeat, realizing that my fight for
existence in a world that doesn’t want testers is futile. I was tired of
having to fight for resources, and trying to convince the developers
that I’m on their side.</p>
<p>I couldn’t stand another day of having to explain to the Scrum Master
and the lead developers why they needed to include me in the technical
sessions, or begged them to fix a critical bug before a customer has to
suffer the consequence of the failure.</p>
<p>The final push came after visiting one of my best friend’s dying
father for a week and seeing how devastated not only he, but also his
family, was after being diagnosed with only a few months to live. Days
went past where he didn’t even got up in the morning, and when he did,
his eyes were empty and his focus somewhere else.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, having returned home, I followed up to find out how
they were doing, just to hear that after the agonizing long wait because
the doctor was on leave, that they made a mistake with the diagnosis. He
wasn’t dying after all.</p>
<p>Working in the healthcare industry at the time, I realized that I was
partly responsible for this trauma and have the power to prevent it. The
only problem was that in reality I was totally powerless.</p>
<p>The developers simply didn’t have the empathy, being too removed from
the patients themselves, and besides, they were only allowed to do what
the Product Owner told them to do. If there isn’t a requirement, they
won’t develop it and the requirements given by the Product Owner is not
to be questioned or changed.</p>
<p>As a last resort, and with my passion for quality, understanding that
quality evolves around meeting user requirements (not a Product Owner’s
interpretation of it), I told this touching story to the responsible
Product Owner in the hope that she at least will realize the impact of
her decisions.</p>
<p>She listened with compassion, agreed that it was a terrible mistake
to have been made, then turned back to her computer screen, not even
considering the possibility that she can at change it.</p>
<p>Not willing to give up on my friend’s father and all the other users
represented by him, I reached out to another Product Owner, hopeful for
more empathy. Yet, the answer again was one of powerless shrugging of
shoulders, being unable to influence the decisions of the Development
Manager and business with regards to requirements.</p>
<p>Tired of this constant and ego-centered tug of war between
disconnected parts of the business, I finally gave up.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-basics">Back to Basics</h2>
<p>As I walked away and started working on projects not related to
software development at all, I gained perspective again, remembering why
testing became so popular in the first place many years ago.</p>
<p><em>The biggest benefit of testing has always been it’s risk
mitigation.</em> By having an objective party look at the software, you
exponentially decrease your risk of delivering faulty software to the
end-user, thus exponentially manage to meet, or improve quality of the
system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s the reason why pair programming works, and that’s the reason
why you have to get an external auditor to prove compliance. There is a
conflict of interest when the same person, or type of person, evaluates
a piece of software as working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like a person misses the huge turtle swimming past while they
are engrossed in observing a beautiful nudibranch or other macro-sealife
when diving, so too the developers are so absorbed in the details of the
code they’ve written, that they easily miss what is obvious to someone
external using the software.</p>
<p>Where pair programming gives an extra pair of eyes on the details of
the code, so the tester gives a different perspective on the whole
system from an external point of view. No matter how good a programmer
you are, it is not possible to look at the same thing from two angles at
the same time.</p>
<p>The tester, if trained well, has the primary role of seeing what the
developers missed, and in my experience, even the best of the best still
end up with errors in their code.</p>
<p>If you’re considering getting rid of your manual test team, ask
yourself the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you rather want to spend a bit more time during development to
find and fix errors? Or do you rather want to fix the errors once the
end-user discovers them?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because if the errors exist, they will be discovered eventually.
<em>The question is, at what cost?</em></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Being agile doesn’t mean that you don’t manually have to test
software.</p>
<p>Being agile is about responding to customer needs promptly, and the
best way to do this, is to know what those customer needs are. Even
though the Product Owner’s primary role is knowing their customer, it’s
not possible to view the same thing from two different sides.</p>
<p>When two people sitting opposite each other views a can of coke in
the middle of the table, each sees something else, yet both are correct.
Similarly, manual testing is that extra pair of objective eyes that
helps you to be more agile.</p>
<p>If you want to be more agile, get a really good tester.</p>

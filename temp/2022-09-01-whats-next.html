    "description": "A practical guide to ensemble programming (mob programming), explaining why it works, how to get started, and how it improves quality, learning, and team relationships.",
    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="a-curious-look-at-the-possibilities-of-agile">A curious look at
the possibilities of agile</h2>
<p>Agile has been around for a few decades now and most companies have
adopted it to at least some level. Naturally, it’s time to think of what
comes after agile. In a recent <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/The-Idea-Hackathon/">virtual lean
coffee</a>, a global group of agile practitioners discussed the topic
and this post and publication is inspired by the feedback from the
session, aiming to answer the question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when we thought we knew all the answers, they changed all the
questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some contemplation on the subject and a long walk on the beach,
three words stand out for me which summarizes all our insights gained in
our discussion into one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Integration, design and human</em></strong>. Here’s my
thinking explained.</p>
<h2 id="integration.-coming-together.">Integration. Coming
together.</h2>
<p><em>Nothing great has ever been done alone. Two heads are better than
one.</em></p>
<p>Two of the most discussed items in our virtual get together was
around blended learning — a coming together of technology and human
instruction, and agile without borders — an adoption of traditionally
software development practices into non-software development
industries.</p>
<p>Less focus will be on the tools, more emphasis on <em>why</em> it
works and the mindset around it. Mainly, I see the emphasis shifting
from an ‘or’ to an ‘and’ perspective, as I discuss in a post dedicated
to the subject which you can find <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/how-to-grow-an-and-mindset-33b6e4b20b9e">here</a>.</p>
<p>Integration of agile tools and an agile mindset. Integration of
currently silo’ed and separate departments into a ‘whole’ organization.
Integration of software development into each aspect of the business,
rather than a separate function. Working together with equal partners in
win-win relationships, where competition is seen as helpful
resources.</p>
<h2 id="design.-lateral-thinking-and-art.">Design. Lateral thinking and
art.</h2>
<p><em>The most exquisite expression of a beautiful mind is good design.
It marries two of my favorite domains, namely problem solving and
art.</em></p>
<p><em>Design is about making something functional beautiful, usable,
enticing. Inviting and delighting a user to share an experience. Adding
technology to the equation augments reality as we know it into a richer,
more beautiful, more sensual experience.</em></p>
<p>Until now, the emphasis of agile software development has mostly been
on the functional aspects and making things work in a specific,
standalone area. A user story is a flat, 2 dimensional view on a tiny
slice of a much bigger pie and the answer to most problems were to add
more.</p>
<p>More functions. More options. More tools. More choices. More
people.</p>
<p>Yet, what distinguishes good design from great, is <em>less</em>, not
more. Great design is niche. It’s simple. It’s intuitive. It’s
exquisite. It’s unique. It’s not merely repackaging Skype, calling
groups channels and rebranding it as Slack. It’s not creating yet
another Trello like board with one or two aspects that is different.
Great design takes your breath away. It’s the beauty and simplicity of
Apple. It’s the useful delight of Nespresso machines. It’s the seamless
integration of beautiful Wave Apps.</p>
<p><em>The future of agile is crafting technical solutions that
delights, increasing the feedback loop between product owner and team,
putting more emphasis on design as a problem solving tool as apposed to
mere aesthetics.</em></p>
<h2 id="human.">Human.</h2>
<p>Above everything else, the future of agile is more human. It
transforms human resources into people and teams. The main difference
between a human being and a robot is emotion. The future of agile
includes emotion and moods and individuality in the professional
environment, not only an aim for an ever increasing velocity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It cares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cares about the impact of decisions on the team who has to do the
work and the users who have to use it. It cares about the environment.
It cares about sustainability. It cares about uplifting and giving back
to the less fortunate.</p>
<p>The future of agile aims for balance. A balance between work and
play. A balance between productive times and rest. A balance between
conflict and harmony. A balance between personal and work lives. A more
wholesome environment where each time you do something, you
<em>really</em> ask yourself whether what you are doing is putting
people over processes and tools.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Agile is maturing fast. What’s next is currently being defined and it
is up to each one of us to shape the direction of agile.</p>
<p>I want to live in a human, healthy, happy world.</p>
<p>A world where technology augments my experience and connects me with
people across the globe. A world where I am able to breathe fresh air
and have fun earning a living. A world that is free from senseless rules
and regulations. A beautiful world where people can express their
individually in the work that they do, because work is passion with
purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of agile is a blank canvas. What are you going to
create?</p>

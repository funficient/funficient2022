<p>Employees are disengaged, productivity is at an all-time low,
customers are unhappy, and you’ve depleted all your resources in an
attempt to keep the boat floating.</p>
<h1 id="the-sinking-ship">The sinking ship</h1>
<p>But the holes are bigger than the buckets to empty the sinking ship,
and you’re quickly running out of options. You’ve tried transitioning to
agile, you’ve tried sending your employees on expensive training
courses, you’ve tried hiring ‘specialists’ at high cost, you’ve tried
cultivating a culture of flexibility and fun — the Google way — and
you’ve tried paying big bonuses and other ‘carrot-and-stick’ motivation
methods to save the day.</p>
<p>Your organization is heavily bleeding, and you desperately need to do
something right now in order to stop the bleeding. It’s a matter of life
and death — your ship is sinking, and it’s sinking fast.</p>
<p>So you look around and find gamification. It promises to transform
boring into fun, underproductive into hyperproductive, and disengaged
employees into loyal ambassadors of your brand.</p>
<p>You give a sigh of relief, Google it and a plug-and-play gamified
solution to add points, badges and leaderboards to your system pops up.
Perfect!</p>
<p>Problem solved. Or is it?</p>
<p>Probably not and I dare to say definitely not, and probably bigger
than before.</p>
<h1 id="magic-only-happens-in-fairy-tales">Magic only happens in Fairy
Tales</h1>
<p>Gamification is not points, badges and leaderboards. Anyone looking
at plug-in options to magically transform boring into playful and fun by
‘gamifying’ their system with adding points, badges and leaderboards are
making a very big, and possibly very expensive, mistake.</p>
<p>It is like putting a band-aid onto a heavily severed limb by an
unqualified and untrained civilian. You are probably doing more harm
than good, even though you’ve got good intentions and even read an
article somewhere or watched an episode of Gray’s Anatomy on TV where
you heard that it is important to stop the bleeding. Your intentions are
good but you lack depth in knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="complexity-and-chaos">Complexity and Chaos</h1>
<p>An organization and it’s integrated systems are as complex as a human
body and there is a reason why doctors need to study longer than most
other professions before they can practice their skill. And even once
qualified it is called a practice because they never fully (respectfully
said) understand their trade and have to keep practicing to get
better.</p>
<p>The human body is simply too complex for any human being to fully
comprehend. No two human being are the same, yet they are all
similar.</p>
<p>For the same reason no two organizations are the same, yet they are
all similar. Similarly, no two gamified solutions are the same, yet they
share common characteristics.</p>
<h1 id="why-gamification-fails">Why Gamification fails</h1>
<p>Like the example of the mis-diagnosis of the severed limb above,
similarly Gamification can only succeed once you fully understand the
problem you intend to solve.</p>
<p>We tend to look for solutions the moment we become aware of a problem
rather than determining the fault root cause of the problem first. That
means you are addressing the symptom, which might give temporary relief,
but will not get rid of the problem.</p>
<h1 id="design-for-success">Design for Success</h1>
<p>Gamification works when it is approached like any other successful
project, and below are the most important steps in the iterative
process.</p>
<p>Gamification for Success</p>
<h1 id="step-1-problem-analysis">Step 1 — Problem Analysis</h1>
<p>In most cases, the problem is not where it hurts the most, so it
makes sense to spend a bit more time trying to find the source of the
problem through various research techniques, such as participatory
research, shadowing, or my personal preferenance — getting your hands
dirty having a look yourself by getting involved in the project.</p>
<p>I’ve never successfully identified the fault root cause of a problem
without being part of the team on some level. Having been an auditor in
the past, asking people questions as an outsider vs having a look by
doing it yourself gives very different results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The first probably will give you the symptom, the second will
more likely lead you to the fault root cause.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tool to help you identify your focus area is a gamestorming (not to
be confused with gamification) game called “Speedboat”. Alternatively,
or additional to that, shadowing (observation) is a method that has been
used successfully in lean manufacturing, but can be applied to knowledge
work environments as much as to manufacturing.</p>
<h1 id="step-2-analyse-your-players">Step 2 — Analyse your Players</h1>
<p>The users, or players, are the essence of your gamified solution, so
this is one of the most important parts of any solution — whether it is
gamification or product design.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/669/1*rFdurP2zaDBdrpkxyFM7yw.png" /></p>
<p>Persona Summary</p>
<p>An organization is a group of individuals working together. Without
understanding your players, you’re not able to design for success.
Depending on your problem, your players might be different, so don’t
first start analyzing users as it might potentially be a waste of
time.</p>
<p>Firstly categorize your players into the four main player types of
your choice (Collaborators, Explorer, Achievers and Competers; DISC
profiling or another methodology of your choice), then define what
constitutes value for each, based on intrinsic rather than extrinsic
motivators.</p>
<p>It’s been proven over and over again that any extrinsic motivation,
whether it is a bonus, a holiday, or paid leave, has a very short
lifespan after which it becomes expected rather than making employees
happy.</p>
<p>Tools to use at this stage of the process includes empathy mapping,
journey mapping (adapted to include the phases of a game like onboarding
and mastering) and persona creation.</p>
<h1 id="step-3-define-your-success-criteria">Step 3 — Define your
success criteria</h1>
<p>Only once you got to know your user a bit better is it possible to
define what success will look like.</p>
<p>How will you know that you’ve succeeded? Maybe once you’ve reached a
financial milestone, or have an increase in customer loyalty and
referrals, or maybe able to deliver products and services faster?</p>
<p>Tried and tested tools to help you includes setting SMART goals and
using the Balanced Scorecard method. From the Innovation Games website,
the “Remember the future” game is very handy, and I’ve recently seen an
in-house developed template called the Brand Engagement Wheel which
identifies the main items for engaging your audience and taking it a
step further by doing a quick feasibility analysis and assigning
ownership right away.</p>
<h1 id="step-4-define-your-solution">Step 4 — Define your Solution</h1>
<p>Only now is it time to start thinking of a solution and where and how
to gamify. Doing this step earlier might feel faster, but in the end of
the day it will cost you much more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Process and people first, tools later.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key to successful problem solving is not to automate too early.
Like wireframes and mockups help to build a website faster, manual
gamification is a much cheaper way to get the solution right and allow
you to make changes based on test feedback from actual users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core purpose of gamifying any system is to make people happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy people do good work, which means higher productivity and better
customer service, which in turn leads to happier customers, which
ultimately translates to higher profitability for the company.
Win-Win.</p>
<p>In most cases employee happiness doesn’t have much to do with the
systems, but rather more about relationships with their team as well as
management. And if I had to choose only one ingredient for a good
relationship it would be good communication.</p>
<p>Points, badges and leaderboards are a form of feedback for improved
communication, but it is far from enough to ‘gamify’ a system. It lacks
meaningful choices, voluntary contribution, an element of surprise
(which is responsible for the addictiveness to games), to name but a few
of the other ingredients of a gamified solution, and mostly, it doesn’t
guarantee fun, except if you are one of the 10% of players categorized
as Achievers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To successfully gamify a system you don’t need technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve managed to gamify a classroom without any technology, and I’ll
risk saying that I was more agile and adaptable to my ‘clients’ needs
without the restrictions that comes with technology.</p>
<p>The best tools I use are sticky notes (always carry them around with
me) and paper prototypes. Other ways to gamify includes adding music
(sound), food (smell) or movement.</p>
<p>Ultimately a good game experience is a sensual experience, meaning it
involves all the senses.</p>
<h1 id="step-5-review-and-respond">Step 5 — Review and Respond</h1>
<p>The final step in the process is to at a predefined milestone review
your metrics against your defined success criteria and make the
necessary changes, and share your findings or improvements.</p>
<p>The tool I like the most to gather the player’s perceptions and ideas
is a game called “I like, I wish, I wonder”, and some form of analytics
to look at the actual results.</p>
<p>The one cannot be viewed without the other, as perception is probably
more important in any change program than the actual results.</p>
<p>Even if you have the stats to prove something works, if the people
using it don’t like it, it won’t last.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Gamification works, but only if it is implemented correctly and with
the necesseary analysis. Game design studios spend millions to get games
right, it is never a quick-fix. They’ve spent years researching user
behavior and what a good game consists of.</p>
<p>To expect a successful gamified solution simply by adding Points,
Badges and Leaderboards is a misunderstanding, and it is an effective
motivation for only about 10% of the audience.</p>
<p>Successful gamification design requires thought, a lot of planning,
and many iterations to get it right. And once you finally get it right,
it’s time to change it to keep it interesting.</p>

<h2 id="a-tool-set-to-create-safety-in-the-workplace">A tool-set to
create safety in the workplace</h2>
<p>High performance teams are teams who trust each other. Teams who feel
safe. Safe to admit when they don’t know the answers. Safe to ask for
what they need. Safe to raise a red flag without the risk of being
blamed for it. Safe to call out a dysfunction when they see it. Safe to
express themselves and their personality. Safe to have an opinion, even
if it’s controversial and not necessarily what you want to hear.</p>
<p>Your primary goal as leader is to create a safe environment, even in
unsafe conditions. You can have the best team, but if they don’t feel
safe, they will spend their brilliant minds devising strategies to be
safe, not innovate or build awesome products.</p>
<p>When you remove the need for constantly having to play political
games to remain safe within an organization, suddenly, you make
available resources to help your teams fly, which in turn will help your
company be more profitable.</p>
<h1 id="what-creates-an-unsafe-environment">What creates an unsafe
environment?</h1>
<p>To understand how to create a safe environment, it’s useful to
understand what creates an unsafe environment first and simply do the
opposite.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, yet, it took us 100 years plus to get where we are
today. Undoing this will probably also take some time. Not 100 years,
but it’s not a switch of a button. It requires a cultural change. And
cultural change takes time.</p>
<p>So let’s unpack what unsafe looks like first before jumping into how
to create safety.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1.-lack-of-information.">Problem #1. Lack of
information.</h2>
<p><em>Bad communication, especially the inability to provide feedback
and make information available, is the root of all evil in my
opinion.</em></p>
<p>When people don’t know what is going on, who they can speak to, and
where to find things, they feel unsafe. It’s like walking in a dark
tunnel. You are afraid because you don’t know whether you might touch a
spider, walk into a wall or slip or trip on an obstacle in the road.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong><em>Solution #1 — How do you give feedback?</em></strong></p>
<p>Introducing more transparency is by far the most powerful tool to
increase psychological safety.</p>
<p>A simple Kanban board is one example of introducing transparency. So
too is removing restrictive user access (which simply screams I don’t
trust you!), descriptive job titles and products, reducing the amount of
documentation (aka removing possible hiding places for failures) and
making meetings open to be attended by anyone interested.</p>
<p>On a more cultural level, however, safety is introduced by providing
<strong><em>feedback</em></strong> (not to be confused by criticism,
which has little value compared to feedback). What are you doing wrong
and why? More importantly, what are you doing
<strong><em>right</em></strong> and why?</p>
<p>From a business perspective, communication is a free tool that can be
implemented right away. Why would you choose
<strong><em>not</em></strong> to use it? For more on my view on how to
be a better communicator and 10 simple techniques to be a better
communicator, read <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/12/22/answer-life-universe-everything/">The
Real Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything</a>.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2.-the-need-for-professionalism.">Problem #2. The need
for professionalism.</h2>
<p>I don’t mean professional in its true meaning of being considered
competent at a craft or profession. I mean professional more commonly
used in the context of separating your personal and work life. Asked to
wear a mask. Asked not to be influenced by the ups and downs of life or
the invisible political warfare in the office environment.</p>

<p>Many professions require you to wear a uniform. When you step into
your uniform, you step out of your personality. For the next few hours,
you put aside everything that does not make you the soldier or surgeon
or superhero. When Superman doesn’t wear his uniform, he’s just nerdy
Clark Kent.</p>
<p>The uniform can be helpful, but it can also be harmful.</p>
<p>The average organization today requires people to be ‘professional’
at work. They are asked to blend in and abide by the unspoken rules,
which often ends up being the <em>opposite</em> of safe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The opposite of psychological safety is professionalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people love wearing shorts and T-shirts to work. Other people
love dressing up. Similarly, some people are most productive in the
mornings, others at night.</p>
<p>But <strong><em>all</em></strong> people have emotions. And unless
you’re on anti-depressants or anti psychotic medication, these emotions
fluctuate. Sometimes there’s highs, sometimes there’s lows. Sometimes
you are inspired. Other times you are tired. Stuck. Unproductive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solution #2 — How do you develop
people?</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological safety is part of the a culture. Actually, it’s the
foundation of culture. Decide what is acceptable and what not, and what
to do about it.</p>
<p>To create a safe environment, create a culture of being human and a
culture of personal development. A culture where it’s ok to have bad
days. And good ones. A culture where you celebrate when a child is born
and accommodate grief when a parent died, without expecting them to be
as productive as they would on average.</p>
<p>Put tools in place to help people develop personally and increase
their emotional intelligence. If you can’t afford a team coach, try
<strong><a
href="http://developmentcrossroads.com/2011/10/10-tips-to-get-started-with-peer-coaching/">peer-coaching</a></strong>.
It’s like pair-programming, but for personal development. Two equal
(this is very important) people partner and have regular, short coaching
sessions for a defined, short time, to guide and hold the other party
accountable to develop in an area of their choice on a personal (or
professional) level.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3.-trying-to-be-fair.">Problem #3. Trying to be
fair.</h2>
<p><em>I’m not you and you’re not me. Being fair is not about treating
everyone the same. It’s about giving everyone what they need and deserve
in relation to their contribution.</em></p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*JJ-_7sIIPvZigXvZtMRT7A.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Measuring people on a bell curve is asking people to be the same as
everyone else. Yet, it’s the outliers that produce the talent, the new
thinking and the innovation that you really yearn for. It’s what makes
people different from everyone else that makes them valuable.</p>
<p>What is fair to expect from one person is not necessary fair to
expect from the next.</p>
<p><em>For a more detailed view on equality, please read <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/07/16/unhappy-workforce/">The
Secret Behind Your Unhappy Workforce</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Solution #3 — What do you reward people
for?</em></strong></p>
<p>Scrap the defaults. They’re mostly wrong in any case. Whole companies
have whole people. Whole people are people with personalities and
hobbies and preferences.</p>
<p>Make everyone a winner. Rather than having <strong>one</strong>
employee of the month, reward each person for how they
<strong><em>contributed</em></strong> to the success of the team as a
whole. One person might have contributed with a creative solution to the
problem. Another might have helped to maintain the harmony in the team
when things got hot. Someone else might have been responsible for
calming down an angry customer. Another for doing all the admin that
no-one else wanted to do.</p>
<p>Train yourself to reward contributions towards a mutual goal rather
than simply measure success and producing averages.</p>
<h2 id="problem-4.-lack-of-personal-confidence.">Problem #4. Lack of
personal confidence.</h2>
<p>Closely related to professionalism, but something out of the control
of the leader, is probably the biggest cause for people to feel unsafe,
but it is something that you can influence. It might be because they are
new to the industry, in a more senior role than what they’re used to, or
simply because they don’t realize their value.</p>
<p><img

<p>It could also be because your expectations are too high, or you
expect your team to know all the answers, or because you don’t show them
your vulnerable side.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solution #4 — How do you demonstrate
failure?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are two dimensions of building confidence, the first is to lead
by example and being willing to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Admit when you don’t know all the answers. Read more about why this
is actually a good thing in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2017/01/05/not-knowing-all-the-answers/">5
Reasons Why Not Knowing All the Answers Makes You a Better Leader</a>.
Celebrate failure. Allow space for mistakes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfection is a waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second dimension is to build confidence by providing feedback,
which has already been discussed in solution #1. Specifically, help the
person to see their value. Tell them what they’re good at and why. Focus
on what they are doing right, not how they can be better.</p>
<h2 id="problem-5.-a-lack-of-trust.">Problem #5. A lack of trust.</h2>
<p>A symptom showing a lack of trust in an organization is
micro-management. Focusing on the <strong><em>how</em></strong> rather
than the <strong><em>why</em></strong>. When you don’t trust people, you
want to control them. When you want to control them, the natural
consequence is that it is not safe for them to be them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solution #5 — How do you lead?</em></strong></p>
<p>Trust is about letting go and probably the hardest lesson of all to
learn. It’s about having the best interest of everyone at heart — not
only your own. It’s about giving a challenge and allowing the team to
find their own solution, using their own tools and their own time to do
it.</p>
<p>Building trust is a process rather than a project with a defined
end-date. It requires that you, as leader change, rather than expecting
your team to change.</p>
<p>To build trust, consistently — over and over and over and
<strong><em>over</em></strong> again — demonstrate presence and support.

href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/08/18/5-ways-build-culture-of-trust/">5
Ways to Build a Culture of Trust.</a></p>
<h1 id="staying-safe">Staying Safe</h1>
<p>Ultimately, establishing psychological safety is a process of earning
trust. It requires, above everything else, presence, consistently. When
you are able to be present, naturally you will listen and enable and
understand.</p>
<p>The consequence of being too busy is that trust is broken. And
winning trust back is much harder than keeping it in the first place. So
each day, ask yourself this one question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Am I breaking or building safety with what I am about to do or
say?”</p>

<p>Watching a series on Netflix is entertaining. It transforms you to a
different world just for a little while, allowing you to forget all your
worries. I know people who can binge-watch an entire series in a single
weekend. No joke.</p>
<p>I’m not one of those people though. I can’t sit still for long
enough. I need to move. I get distracted easily by anything in my
surroundings. I want to get up to make coffee, I start thinking about
other things, or engage in conversation while I’m watching. It just
doesn’t engage me enough.</p>
<p>Watching a live performance, however, is something that captures my
undivided attention for the duration of the show or play, leaving me
yearning for more after it’s finished.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it’s the same thing. It’s both watching a performance
— the being one digital, the other in person. Yet, my reaction and
ability to concentrate is vastly different from the one to the other.
<em>Why?</em></p>
<h2 id="creating-engagement-through-flow">Creating engagement through
flow</h2>
<p>Taking this back to the workplace and why this is important, your
capacity to concentrate directly equates to how enjoyable an experience
is as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains in his book <em>Flow</em>.</p>
<p>And what workplace doesn’t want motivated and engaged employees?</p>
<p>Flow is what creates engagement and motivation, ultimately resulting
in higher productivity. The more you are able to concentrate on what you
are doing, the more enjoyable it is, the higher your productivity.</p>
<p><em>So why can I concentrate better when the show is live? What are
the conditions that make a live performance more engaging than a digital
one?</em></p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure to be honest. What I <em>do</em> know is that a
live performance evokes much more emotion in me than any TV show. I’m
<em>actively</em> engaged in what I’m watching, feeling included in the
experienced rather than being an objective observer, excluded.</p>
<p>Seeing the bodies move, the facial expressions, hearing the rustling
of clothes or props being moved around and the more extensive visual
stimulation grabs my attention so much that I forget about my
surroundings. The surprise when an actor comes from the back that I
didn’t expect, the lights and sounds and smells surrounding me is more
engaging than watching anything digitally.</p>
<p>It’s more <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>Real, being translated to <em>sensual</em>. More senses are
stimulated and the entire space around me is part of the experience.
It’s not limited in space and senses as it it on TV. And this is
ultimately what makes any experience more engaging. It is also key to
coming up with better solutions to your problems in fact.</p>
<h2 id="perception-and-processing-to-problem-solve-better">Perception
and Processing to Problem Solve Better</h2>
<p>Thinking can be broken down into two distinct phases. The first, and
more important from the perspective of problem solving, is perception,
or taking in all the different stimuli in our surroundings. The second
is making sense of this stimuli and ordering these ‘things’ into
information, processing the stimuli and storing it for later use.</p>
<p>The more senses thus involved in an experience, the greater our
ability to receive stimuli, increasing our perception. The more we
perceive, the more information we can derive from these external stimuli
and the better we are able to understand a problem or define a
solution.</p>
<h2 id="stop-thinking-start-doing">Stop thinking, start doing</h2>
<p>Yet, we often rely only on our verbal communication skills and
<em>thinking</em> about a solution to identify or validate
opportunities. We sit for hours in a boardroom talking about a possible
solution. We brainstorm by coming up with as many ideas we have on a
topic, without leaving the room or interacting with anyone else.</p>
<p>It’s a one-way flow of thoughts from our minds onto the white-board
with little feedback.</p>
<p><em>And then there was <a
href="https://gamestorming.com/bodystorming/">bodystorming</a>….</em></p>
<p>Not technically an agile game, but rather an improv theatre method
applied in the business world, it is also called <strong><em>use-case
theatre</em></strong> or a <strong><em>participatory
design</em></strong> technique. It’s designed to include human responses
and emotions to situations and interactions to gain immediate feedback,
mostly used by user experience designers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where brainstorming is designed to identify solutions, bodystorming
is designed to identify gaps or opportunities in the problem itself,
allowing as a result for a better solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bodystorming has the added benefit of including the physical body in
a role-playing activity to uncover insights on a far greater scale than
is possibly with traditional brainstorming alone, also called tacit
knowledge, or knowing more than what we can explain or describe. It adds
the dimension of relationships between objects and forces not as easily
achieved by merely thinking about it, making it easier to understand
cause-and-effect.</p>
<h1 id="benefits-of-bodystorming">Benefits of bodystorming</h1>
<p>We, as a human species, tend to be over-confident in our abilities.
Or at least, I know I am guilty. We think we are much better at doing or
knowing things than what we really are. We tend to under-estimate the
effort it takes to complete a task and we tend to think we know more
than what we really do about any given subject.</p>
<p>That’s probably the biggest reason why people tend to discard
seemingly simple techniques like bodystorming as not necessary or
valuable. They <em>mentally</em> think there is little benefit in the
added effort of setting up and running through a play-like scenario than
just running through it in your mind and talking about it. They
inaccurately think that cutting out the physical interactions are
faster.</p>
<p>But thinking about a problem or situation is not the same as
physically acting it out. By acting it out you gain immediate feedback
in a much richer environment than what can be done by thinking about it.
The acting out of use-cases allows for more use-cases to be evaluated.
It also includes kinesthetic stimulation and body-language, resulting in
faster and better communication.</p>
<p>There are many more benefits to using bodystorming, with the most
important ones:</p>
<h2 id="better-able-to-understand-the-problem">1. Better able to
understand the problem</h2>
<p>By acting out a situation, we put more attention on understanding the
problem than by identifying a solution. The average person tends to jump
to solution mode before we fully understand the problem we’re trying to
solve.</p>
<p>It takes some effort to train yourself to first focus on the problem.
When we completed our Business Analysis training, we, as most people
before us, all fell into the trap of coming up with ideas before
spending adequate time uncovering the problem. We all glanced over the
problem and argued that we understand the problem already.</p>
<p>Yet, time after time when posed a question by the patient teacher, we
were proven wrong. We <em>didn’t</em> in fact understand the problem as
well as we thought we did. In our haste to solve it, we missed some
obvious things. It was only when we were forced to slow down and truly
look at the problem that we realized how much we overlooked.</p>
<p>We practiced this skill of spending more time on the problem and came
to value the sentiments of one of the biggest genius of our time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking
about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.” — Albert
Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Who are we to argue with genius?</em> Einstein argued that if you
hope to find a solution to a problem, you first need to <em>really</em>
understand the problem you intend to solve.</p>
<p><em>Bodystorming</em> provides an opportunity for us to delve deeper
into understanding the problem. It includes context, it shows the
relationships between different forces far better than what can be seen
by thinking about something alone.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-feedback">2. Rapid feedback</h2>
<p>This more contextual and interactive method means feedback is
immediate and we can more rapidly adapt our approach or plan, supporting
the <strong>agile manifesto</strong> of:</p>
<p><em>Responding to change over following a plan.</em></p>
<p>By having a team of individuals, each with a unique set of experience
and skill interact on the same problem, each with a different
understanding of the problem, we are able to get a much more complete
picture of any given situation.</p>
<p>By acting out experiences, we tap into the collective intelligence of
the group rather than one person’s good idea. We find an intersection
between <em>a lot of</em> good ideas. We broaden our coverage by
including different and diverse perspectives on a given situation and we
can immediately see the effect of our thinking by the response we
receive.</p>
<h2 id="lower-costs">3. Lower costs</h2>
<p>The secondary benefit, maybe much more important to business, is that
faster feedback means lower expenses.</p>
<p>The sooner we are able to discover a gap in our thinking or a problem
with our intended solution, the cheaper it is to fix. Contrary, the
longer we invest in a solution the more likely we are to hold on to it,
even if it’s not such a good idea. We’ve seen this so many times in the
business world where legacy software is used simply because the
investment was so high. Or, we continue with a specific service
provider, even though their service and product is far from the best,
because we try to avoid the pain of moving.</p>
<p>When we bodystorm a solution or a problem, we only spend a few man
hours. There is no technology or physical prototypes included, bar some
very simple props, making it easy to discard or adapt an idea, and much
more cost-effective.</p>
<p>Did we take this same idea, brainstorm, prototype, develop and
present it to users to validate only to find out an issue, we spent
thousands of man hours and the cost of technology.</p>
<h2 id="increased-collaboration">4. Increased collaboration</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest problem in most large organizations is the lack
of collaboration among team members. We tend to compete rather than
collaborate. Rather than a <em>yes, <strong>and</strong></em> we see a
solution as a <em>yes, <strong>but</strong></em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s either your idea or mine. May the best man win.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is contra-productive and breaks down relationships rather than
improve them. When people competes to have <em>the</em> best idea, the
underlying message is that <em>I</em> am more important than
<em>we</em>.</p>
<p>Bodystorming solves this problem beautifully because each person in
the team has a specific role attempting to solve a mutual goal. Even
though each team member might have different ideas about the solution,
they combine these different ideas to find a more comprehensive solution
to the problem.</p>
<h2 id="its-more-fun">5. It’s more fun</h2>
<p>When you’re really honest with yourself, few people enjoy meetings
and talking about ideas or solutions. It’s much more fun when you can be
<em>part</em> of the discussion and even more fun when you can
participate by acting it out, as most people struggle to express all
their thoughts and ideas concisely.</p>
<p>We are geared to move. We enjoy sports, dance and most outdoor
hobbies because we are free to move. The movement allows our muscles to
work and that requires more oxygen to move through out bodies.</p>
<p><em>Moving makes us happy.</em> Read more about how to create <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/07/18/happiness-at-work/">happy
workplaces with movement here</a>.</p>
<p>Bodystorming adds much more movement to the act of problem solving
than any form of brainstorming or meeting, making it a more fun
activity. The more fun we have, the more likely we are to be engaged and
participate.</p>
<p>Scientifically, this movement increases our ability to access our
memory, which is stored in our bodies, not just in our heads. That’s why
you get that idea only <em>after</em> the meeting. The more you move the
more you are able to access your existing knowledge.</p>
<p>Bodystorming is also fun because of the social interaction between
team members. One of our most primary needs is a need for social
connection.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-play">How to play</h1>
<p>Bodystorming can be used for many reasons, making it an extremely
versatile game to have in your toolset. It is great for problem solving,
it is also great for ideation or coming up with new solutions, it is as
good for validating or testing concepts or ideas. It can even be used to
identify team dysfunctions or improve dynamics within a a team.</p>
<p>It can be used in different ways, with a more generic version of the
<a href="https://www.funficient.club/bodystorming.html">game
instructions available here</a> with a video showing an example of
play.</p>
<p>A scenario is presented to a group of 5–8 people (it can be used for
larger groups too). For example, designing a hospital patient
information management system.</p>
<p>A narrator is selected, who facilitates the entire game, and each
person is assigned a role, either as a person in the process, or a prop,
like a table or a bed. Props have emotions and can speak as people.</p>
<p>The workflow is acted out by the different actors while the narrator
controls the “show”, introducing new use-cases or variations, rewinding
or pausing play to discuss an insight.</p>
<p>After the scenario’s have been acted out, the team discusses the
insights received during play.</p>
<p>The game can also be combined with other gamestorming games or
game-techniques too. <a

this post</a> to find out how bodystorming was used doing market
research for an internet cafe here.</p>
<h1 id="play-more-for-better-insights">Play more for better
insights</h1>
<p>Play is often discarded as a waste of time and something that doesn’t
belong in the workplace. Yet, if you’re willing to give it a chance,
you’ll notice that you gain much more and better insights much faster
using these more playful techniques, while saving both cost and
time.</p>
<p>Bodystorming is a fun, collaborative method to identify possible gaps
and opportunities in a process. Go on, give it a try and let me know how
well it worked for you.</p>

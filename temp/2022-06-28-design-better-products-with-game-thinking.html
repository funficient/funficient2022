    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="a-simple-but-not-simplistic-design-approach.">A simple, but not
simplistic, design approach.</h2>
<p>UX designers and Product Owners spend a lot of time researching good
products in order to design something you hope will engage your audience
for the long haul. For me, it’s like building a puzzle, taking one piece
from this product and another piece from another successful product I
like and weaving it into a single tapestry. It can, however, become
overwhelming for larger products. Losing track of the core intent and
value proposition, even for an experienced designer, is easy. That’s
where the gamethinking framework shines.</p>
<h2 id="changing-priorities">Changing priorities</h2>
<p><em>The biggest issue I see in software development productivity is
that teams loose focus of what’s important.</em> They get so busy
building that they forget <em>why</em> they are building it in the first
place. They focus so much on one piece of the puzzle and the intricacies
of how that part should work that they often loose sight of the bigger
picture.</p>
<p>I consider myself a big picture perspective person. I struggle when I
can’t see the bigger picture. And even with this natural skill that I’ve
developed even more over the years I too often get lost in the details
when building or designing software.</p>
<p>Until I stumbled upon the <a href="https://gamethinking.io/">Game
Thinking</a> framework by Amy Jo Kim, a game designer and entrepreneur.
I resonated with her as she claims to blend game design , startups and
agile practices — all the areas I am also passionately interested in —
and wanted to learn more. After attending a few of her webinars I tried
her product teardown framework — a mini UX audit focused on evaluating
long-term engagement of products.</p>
<p>I evaluated <strong><a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6rq5ox5UPyM8JAxZ5SRuFXNUrhxXl9h/view?usp=sharing">Luno</a></strong>
as part of a user research project for designing a crypto-currency
self-bank solution and realized I struck gold when my entire body
responded with an audible sigh of excitement and relief as I looked at
the summary at the end of the process. At a glance, I could see the
entire user journey to mastery. While using Luno I realized something
bothers me but I couldn’t quite articulate it until I put all the puzzle
pieces together. Suddenly it was clear why I lost interest after a few
weeks, even though on the surface it was a good product. The Game
Thinking product teardown pinpointed the problem with accuracy that
enables action to improve it.</p>
<p>The Game Thinking framework combines the progression levels of game
design with the lean startup model, agile user stories and the general
marketing cycle.</p>
<h1 id="building-a-whole-product">Building a whole product</h1>
<p>The most fundamental aspect of the Game Thinking framework is the
game design user journey mechanism called progression levels, something
inherent and fundamental to the game design process. Game designers
spend a lot of time researching human behaviour and motivation. They
understand it better than most industries as their entire reason for
existence can be narrowed down to their ability to engage people to play
a game over everything else in their life at that moment. Unlike retail,
financial services or medical services, games are pure entertainment.
No-one has to play a game. You choose to play a game. If it’s not
engaging enough you’ll put it down and move onto something else.</p>

alt="A summary of the user mastery journey for the game thinking framework." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A summary of the user mastery journey for
the game thinking framework.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Summary of the four main <em>phases</em> of the Game Thinking
framework.</p>
<p>They research the art of engagement and mapping out the progression
levels are their primary compass to ensure they focus on engagement
first. This process is similar to the marketing sales process and starts
off with getting a target user’s attention in the
<strong>Discovery</strong> phase. The Discovery phase attempts to get a
new user to become aware and interested in the product and not
necessarily part of the product but essential for the product life
cycle.</p>
<p>The next phase is focused on helping a new user to get started as
easy as possible in the <strong>Onboarding</strong> process. Product
designers can learn a lot from a game designers approach to onboarding.
In game design the complexity emerges throughout the game play with new
features being unlocked as you progress. It starts off with one core
mechanic in training levels which is so easy that it is impossible to
get it wrong. Imagine redesigning a complex system like the Adobe suite
or Blender to up-skill new users rather than overwhelm them with new
features all at once? A lot more users will use a lot more features when
they are guided through the complexity rather than just pushed into the
deep end to swim or sink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fun is just another word for learning.” — Raph Koster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next phase is the heart of a game, and a product. In the
<strong>Habit Building</strong> phase the goal is to get get users to
come back each day. To fully appreciate the importance of this part of
the process I recommend reading “A theory of fun” by Raph Koster who
summarizes “Fun is just another word for learning.” The Habit Building
phase is designed around a core learning loop with the game thinking
behind it that you want to make the users better, not the product. This
constant empowerment of a user makes it addictive and psychology is at
the core of this phase.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>Mastery phase</strong> is for those select few
hard-core players who become the ambassadors for the game. There are
usually only a handful of users who become masters at the game but these
people will invest a lot of effort into making the product better and
selling it to their friends. Microsoft and Google, amongst others,
strategy and reason for success to a high degree is because they only
employ those people who have proven themselves to be true ambassadors of
their products. To be considered for an employee at these giants you
have to breathe the company and can even be considered as zealots who
will do pretty much anything for their company because they believe in
it so much. This is a super powerful, although not entirely healthy,
approach to grow a company or product’s reputation and the mastery phase
focuses on these handful of users to build brand ambassadors.</p>
<h1 id="succinct-requirements-with-agile-user-stories">Succinct
requirements with agile user stories</h1>
<p>The next layer that makes the Game Thinking framework so great is
that it adds the agile method of stating requirements as user stories in
a set recipe to ensure it is succinctly focused on value delivery. It
builds a bridge between the product’s vision and actionable steps.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">High level user stories for each phase of
the Game Thinking process phase.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>High level user stories for each phase of the Game Thinking process
phase.</p>
<p>Requirements can get messy.</p>
<p>When you come from a business analysis background as me you might
have stumbled upon death by requirements, either in various versions of
thick documents filled with business requirements, functional
specifications, and technical specifications, or requirements management
systems such as JIRA where each requirement and error is logged in a
system with a unique identifier. No matter how good, no one person can
ever know the exact impact of a single requirement and no one document
usually contains everything both business and developers need in order
to build it. In most cases, more time is spent on managing the
requirements and errors as a result of oversights than building new
features. Messy. And unproductive to say the least.</p>
<p>When, on the other hand you come from a UI design background, you
might be familiar with design systems and death by screens. Equally
messy, but in a different way and slightly more comprehensible by the
average person than the piles of documents produced by business analysts
as a picture is less prone to being misunderstood than words. Still
messy though. And still unproductive, and potentially more
expensive.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of these two extremes, however, is a sweet spot
called user-, or job stories. If used incorrectly these stories might
feel like exactly the same mess as the other ways, but if used
correctly, it brings clarity and focus like nothing else.</p>
<p>Agile software development introduced the concept of user stories,
which in effect is just a small portion of a much larger requirement
with a business benefit and target audience in a single sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AS A</strong> <user type> <strong>I WANT</strong>
<unique system feature> <strong>SO THAT</strong>
<value or benefits>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, AS A new crypto user I WANT to buy crypto currency with
my fiat bank account SO THAT I can participate in the benefits of crypto
currencies. This works well when there are a number of different users,
however, in my experience few systems truly have different personas
using it. Or, it is only valuable when starting off with a new
system.</p>
<p>Job stories solves this problem by removing the persona and focusing
on the trigger of the event. The user type of a user story is omitted
and the format now becomes WHEN <trigger> I WANT <unique system feature>
SO THAT <benefit or value>. I like to add a dimension of emotions and
translate each story into a desired feeling as benefit understanding
that everything we do is in an attempt to feel a certain way. Adding
this positive desired emotion to each user story communicates empathy to
the developers and help make better product decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong> <trigger> <strong>I WANT</strong>
<unique system feature> <strong>SO THAT</strong> <benefit or value>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, WHEN I have extra cash to invest I WANT an easy way to
buy crypto currencies SO THAT I can feel empowered taking full control
over my personal finances. The job story for each phase is focused on
communicating an overall intent. It gives direction and focus. It
creates boundaries to make it more achievable to build one complete
thing rather than a bunch of parts that doesn’t quite form a whole
picture.</p>
<p>For each of the phases within the user journey or mastery path,
depict a primary intent job story. When you get into the details of each
phase, these stories will guide you towards your initial intent and help
decision making. Each time you decide to add or build a new function,
use this primary story as filter. Will it enable the user to easily buy
crypto currencies? Will the user feel empowered with the design?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, re-evaluate whether the function should be built
or whether the designs should be adapted to more closely align with the
original intent.</p>
<h1 id="better-products-need-better-thinking">Better products need
better thinking</h1>
<p>Trying to keep sane when working with complex and complicated
products has little to do with your memory skills or cognitive
abilities. The human brain can only process roughly 4–8 items in working
memory. You can either try to prove science wrong, or you can work with
what science has proven as optimal and build better products
incrementally.</p>
<p>The Game Thinking framework is a simplified (but not simplistic) tool
that allows you to design a comprehensive whole product. On a single
page, you can see the entire product mastery journey as a high-level
zoom that will enable you to think better and thus build better
products.</p>

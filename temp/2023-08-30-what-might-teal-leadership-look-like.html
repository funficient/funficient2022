<h1 class="title">What might teal leadership look like?</h1>

<p>If you’re familiar with Frederic Laloux’s <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-09-01-reinventing-organizations/">Reinventing
Organizations</a>and his model of organizational development, you might
know that organizations operating from a mainly teal paradigm have a
flat hierarchy with self-managing teams.   Self-managed, autonomous
teams don’t, however, mean no more leaders.  In fact, it requires
leadership even more than ever before.  Just in a different way.  It
requires teal leadership.</p>
<p>The main difference, compared to a more traditional ‘orange’
organization, is that leadership in a ‘teal’ organization is
distributed.  This is the second in a series of posts outlining the main
teal practices. This post looks at the characteristics of leadership in
an organization operating mainly from a teal paradigm, and how to get
from where you are towards teal.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-an-orange-management-control-type-leader">Characteristics
of an ‘orange’ management &amp; control type leader</h2>
<p>An organization predominantly operating from an orange paradigm has a
management and control type of <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/05/25/effective-leadership-style/">leadership
style</a> as standard.  This is in line with the top-down
decision-making and power distribution as described in a previous post
discussing what the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">structure
of a more teal-like organization</a> might look like.</p>
<p>In a predominantly ‘orange’ organization, the manager typically wants
to know what’s going on at all times in an attempt to feel in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/10/16/trust-and-control/">control</a>.
People spend a lot of time and effort producing detailed plans and
status reports.</p>
<p>Plans are typically seen as a predefined one-way road towards a
destination. When there is an obstacle it first has to be overcome. This
is like driving to a destination and encountering a roadblock. Rather
than adapt the route, typically, the strategy is to add more time to the
schedule.</p>
<h2 id="follow-rules-at-all-cost">Follow rules at all cost</h2>
<p>Typically, there are standardized procedures that have to be followed
at all times. When something requires a different approach, you first
need to ask permission. Often, adapting these policies and procedures is
time and resource intensive, making it easier to simply comply than
attempt to change it. This often results in a slow and frustrating
process.  To get to a specific state or outcome you have to jump through
several hoops.</p>
<h2 id="rule-from-the-top">Rule from the top</h2>
<p>A typical ‘orange’ leader tells people what to do in a top-down
approach, inviting little feedback. Often, they make decisions in
isolation from their ‘ivory’ tower based on facts in reports and
opinions of trusted advisors. People on the ground have little to no
decision-making power.</p>
<p>The leader is seen as the one with all the answers. When they don’t
know an answer, they perceive it as a weakness.  They struggle to admit
when they don’t know and refrain from asking for help.</p>
<h2 id="there-can-be-only-one">There can be only one</h2>
<p>As discussed in the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">organizational
structure</a> post, in a typical ‘orange’ organization there can be only
one leader at the top of the pyramid. This scarcity results in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/15/competition-in-the-workplace/">competition</a>
and corruption as everyone competes to get to the top, often to the
detriment of another person. It requires a survival of the fittest,
predatory mindset.</p>
<p>These leaders, who have worked long and hard to achieve their status,
will most likely hold onto their position for as long as possible. They
know there is nowhere to go once they reach the top of the ladder.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-a-teal-distributed-leader">Characteristics of
a ‘teal’ distributed leader</h2>
<p>Leadership in a mostly ‘teal’ organization, on the other hand, is
distributed with several self-organizing, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/09/18/autonomous-teams/">autonomous</a>
teams.  Where in a typical ‘orange’ organization leadership is a scarce
resource, in a typical ‘teal’ organization everyone needs to act as a
leader.  The more fluid structure with rotating responsibilities allows
everyone to practice and improve their leadership skills.</p>
<h2 id="trust-vs-control">Trust vs control</h2>
<p>The typical ‘teal’ leader, in contrast to ‘orange’, asks questions
rather than gives answers. Leadership takes on a <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/08/19/agile-coaching/">coaching
relationship</a>. The assumption is that when someone needs guidance
they will seek out a coach.  There is a belief that employees (or
partners) can be <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/10/16/trust-and-control/">trusted
and don’t need to be controlled</a>.</p>
<p>The coach assumes that the person has the answer already, they simply
need to be reminded how to access it. Their role is to guide
decision-making and growth through questions. The primary goal is to
raise self-awareness and ensure more complete thinking.</p>
<p>Coaching is typically an advice-free zone where people are free to
make mistakes.  This also means they have to own these mistakes and
carry the consequences.  There are no bosses to buffer a junior from
mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="distributed-decision-making">Distributed decision making</h2>
<p>In a ‘teal’ organization, decision-making is distributed.  There is
not a decision maker as such, but rather a decision-making process. 
Each person is equally empowered to make decisions.  When there is a
problem, they initiate the process.  This means each person in the team
has to be responsible for teal to work, and why it can’t be rolled out
as a big bang project.  These leadership skills first need to be
developed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good decision making is part of the design of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary benefit of distributed decision-making is that there is
no single point of failure within the system.  This makes the system
much more <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/19/a-recipe-for-resilience/">resilient</a>
and secure.  It also introduces the possibility to create a structure
that can outlive the founders.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-is-a-leader">Everyone is a leader</h2>
<p>In a ‘teal’ organization, in line with the more circular
organizational structure, each person is expected to grow into a leader.
This, however, does not mean that it is anarchy with everyone making
decisions as and when it pleases them. Rather, it means that everyone
gets a <em>chance</em> to become a leader. This reduces the need for
competition and corruption and promotes collaboration. This principle
should be reflected in their <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/06/09/teal-hiring/">hiring
process</a>.</p>
<p>Leadership is seen as a <a
href="https://peerdom.medium.com/the-advantages-of-defining-job-roles-instead-of-job-positions-d2817a3c8d46">role</a>
rather than a person. Leadership responsibilities are broken into
different tasks, each being rotated by the board members.    For an
example of how it practically works when you get rid of the CEO, take a
look at the <a href="https://dna.crisp.se/docs/decisions.html">Crisp
DNA</a> which has transitioned rather seamlessly and successfully. 
Another great resource with processes and examples is the <a
href="https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/theory/decision-making/">official
wiki</a>.</p>
<h2 id="voluntary-contribution">Voluntary contribution</h2>
<p>As everything in a teal organization is voluntary, people volunteer
to take on one or more of these leadership responsibilities for a
specified duration or project, knowing that someone else will get a
chance on the next iteration or project.</p>
<p>A key success factor to further mitigate the risk of anarchy is the
<a
href="https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/theory/decision-making/">advice
process</a>, which is one of the required processes needed to be
classified as a teal organization.</p>
<h2 id="advice-and-inclusion">Advice and inclusion</h2>
<p>A key difference between a predominantly ‘orange’ and ‘teal’ leader
is that people ask for advice when needed. This <a
href="https://thejourney.reinventingorganizations.com/216.html">advice
process</a> is the primary strategy for inclusion and influence.
Whenever a decision needs to be made, key role players are asked for
advice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good advice process requires responsible people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice process can arguably make or break a ‘teal’ organization.
In principle, the process requires the decision maker to consult
everyone who will be meaningfully impacted by a decision and anyone who
might have expertise in the matter. This advice serves as input into the
decision-making process. The decision maker who initiated the process
has the final say.</p>
<h2 id="rotating-responsibilities">Rotating responsibilities</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, a key to a more resilient and long-lived
organization is the concept of rotating leadership responsibilities.</p>
<p>These rotating responsibilities are best described by the metaphor of
a jazz band. Each musician is a master in their way.  During a
performance, each player gets a chance to shine.  A good jazz band
carefully listens and responds to the other players in an improv
style.</p>
<p>Inspired by this jazz band metaphor, software development follows
this principle of rotating responsibilities in <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-06-22-how-to-get-started-with-mobbing-or-ensemble-programming/">ensemble-style
programming</a>. An ensemble typically has three roles – the driver,
navigator, and team. Every 5 – 7 minutes the role is rotated so that
everyone gets a chance, regardless of their level of expertise.  A more
diverse team in terms of skills often produces the best outcomes and
learning.</p>
<p>The terminology for these roles is inspired by a rally race. The
driver is the person steering the wheel while the navigator is the one
with the map.  In a professional environment, the driver does the work
obeying the instructions from the navigator, who is the one responsible
for making the decisions and initiating the advice process.</p>
<p>The rest of the team are more general contributors. They might point
out whenever something is overlooked, do research in the background, or
offer suggestions. When there are different opinions, the navigator is
the one to make the final call.  If someone strongly disagrees with a
decision made by a navigator, they accept the outcome but can question
and reverse it when it is their chance to be the navigator.</p>
<p>This leads me to the next key characteristic required for
successfully leading in a teal way, namely the importance of
consent.</p>
<h2 id="consent">Consent</h2>
<p>Consent is a foundational prerequisite for respect.  Having consent
ultimately aims to find a win-win solution. It doesn’t mean that
everyone has to fully agree with a solution, it rather means there is no
strong objection to a proposed solution.</p>
<p>Consent is not about convincing people that one’s idea is better. 
Rather, it is inclusive, taking everyone’s ideas and building on them
incrementally.  The outcomes are driven by the vision while upholding
the values.  In other words, it is first and foremost about <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/07/most-productive-thing/">alignment</a>,
understanding that an aligned team is a more productive team.</p>
<p>Where an ‘orange’ leader has veto power to overrule a decision, a
‘teal’ leader aims for consent. With everyone equally important,
although valued for different skills and capabilities, a teal leader’s
primary tool for power is their ability to reach consent before acting.
A teal leader never bulldozes, unless perhaps in the event of a natural
disaster or other crisis requiring immediate action without time for
consent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no zero-sum games in a teal organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teal leadership requires an <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/11/08/open-minded-leader/">open
mind</a> and the ability to objectively look at options.  The teal
leader includes all the different perspectives and ensures all the
voices are heard.  In the case of a serious objection, a mutually
beneficial solution is sought.</p>
<p>There are no zero-sum games.  If everyone isn’t on board an
alternative is sought out.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<h3 id="clarify-the-vision-and-values">1. Clarify the vision and
values</h3>
<p>The vision and values serve as the north pole of an organization
without a CEO or manager.  To make good decisions the values must be
clear.   The first step is to clarify and agree on the vision and the
values.</p>
<p>If you already have values defined, spend time comparing the
written-down values with what users and customers say and appreciate
about the product or service. Values need to be grounded in reality and
honest.  It can’t be a dream in the sky or a desired outcome.  Values
are actively used every day.  Each decision must support and strengthen
the values.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-coaching-practices">2. Introduce coaching
practices</h3>
<p>The core difference between leading by management and leading without
power relates to the ability to ask questions. Thus, a possible next
step would be to introduce coaching practices into the organization.</p>
<p>This can be done in many ways, but essentially you want to model to
your employees what coaching is.  The best way to learn the value of
coaching is to experience it yourself.  Consider making coaching hours
available to start with.  Then decide on a strategy to roll out coaching
organization-wide.  Maybe it is sending everyone on coach training, or
maybe it is rolling out a peer-coaching program.</p>
<p>What is more important is that each person has a correct
understanding of coaching and the main process of coaching. Many people
see <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/08/19/agile-coaching/">coaching</a>
as giving advice.  It’s often compared to a sports coach who helps teams
improve their techniques by observing them closely.  While there is
value in this, this is not true coaching.   It’s rather a form of
mentorship and consulting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True coaching is an advice-free zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True coaching is an advice-free zone.  Essentially it is a process to
clarify a solution to a problem and drive meaningful action. Coaching
can be compared to a midwife helping a mother give birth to a child. 
The mother experiences the pain and gives birth. No one can do it for
her.  Similarly, the coach is simply guiding from the side.  They’re
your outer compass and mirror, reminding you when you get off track.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-a-decision-making-advice-process">3. Introduce a
decision-making &amp; advice process</h3>
<p>Another next meaningful step would be to define and implement a
simple decision-making and advice process.  Here is an <a
href="https://medium.com/@jorgen.karlsson/the-power-of-collaborative-decision-making-implementing-the-advice-process-in-teal-organizations-42431dac28b1">example</a>
of a clear, complete, and universal decision-making process.</p>
<p>Essentially, make sure everyone knows how and when to make a
decision.  Then, empower people to act responsibly.  The decision-making
process is arguably the most important in a distributed ‘teal’
environment.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-ensemble-style-meetings">4. Introduce ensemble-style
meetings</h3>
<p>Finally, it is time to break down the current management tasks and
distribute these responsibilities in a rotating style.</p>
<p>To ease the transition, allow the CEO and managers to voluntarily
offer tasks they no longer wish to own to be distributed.  These tasks
can then simply be written on a to-do board or backlog and in each
meeting or at the start of each project ask for volunteers to own this
responsibility.</p>
<p>At the end of the project or meeting the task is returned to the
board, allowing the next person to own it at the next meeting or
project.</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

</header>
<p>When the first lock-down as a result of the pandemic was announced, I
was angry. Having been working remotely for years prior to the pandemic,
I was very familiar with how technology amplifies any communication
issues that might exist. I also know that the most common problem
amongst teams is communication. It is rare to find a team that
communicates well. I was <em>not</em> happy to be forced to go remote
full-time.</p>
<p>However, a year later, I am enjoying remote work so much I don’t
think I ever want to return to an office environment again. I’ve come to
appreciate the benefits to my quality of life, which in turn increases
the quality of my work. I’ve also learned how to more effectively
communicate online as a result of being forced to work remotely.</p>
<h1 id="benefits-of-remote-work">Benefits of remote work</h1>
<p>Before we jump into <em>how</em> to connect online, let’s first
highlight the top three benefits of working remotely as building blocks
for building relationships online.</p>
<h2 id="psychological-safety-increases">1. Psychological safety
increases</h2>
<p>In an open-space office I always felt I had to be careful what I say
as there’s bound to be someone overhearing the tail end of a
conversation without the necessary context to make up a story of their
own.</p>
<p>A lot of energy was wasted in curating thoughts before spoken while
in an open office environment, and as a result the message was often
diluted and open to misunderstanding, or not said at all.</p>
<p>In a remote setting, <strong>it feels like being in a safe little
bubble</strong> where I can say exactly what I want without risking
being overheard by the wrong people or my message getting
misinterpreted.</p>
<p>The result has been that my relationships with my co-workers have
improved. Because we feel safe to vent, ask stupid questions, or chat
about non-work related stuff and be more casual with each other, we are
more relaxed with each other, know each other better, and thus work much
better together.</p>
<h2 id="more-time-to-think">2. More time to think</h2>
<p>One of the biggest issues in an office environment is that people
tend to spend a lot of energy trying to look busy. Inevitably, according
to Murphy’s Law, if you are busy for 7 hours of the day and spend just
10 minutes relaxing by playing a game or scrolling through social media,
your manager will walk past your desk exactly during the 10 minutes of
downtime.</p>
<p>Managers often (wrongly) believe that the busier teams are, the more
productive they are. Efficiency is often measured in how busy everyone
is, rather than the quality of the products delivered.</p>
<p>This might be more true for a production plant where the more
efficient machines are used the more products can be produced. However,
even a production plant needs to be designed so that there aren’t any
pile-up of resources in one area to create bottlenecks.</p>
<p>In a knowledge work environment, the busier you are, the probability
of being unproductive increases exponentially — a topic for a separate
post — but watch T<a href="https://youtu.be/CostXs2p6r0">he Resource
Utilization Trap</a> by Henrik Kniberg below for a brief summary of why
being busy is not necessarily productive.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCostXs2p6r0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCostXs2p6r0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCostXs2p6r0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube">The
resource utilization trap</a></p>
<p>Having worked on my own and as a knowledge worker for a long time, I
know that I’m most productive when I go for a walk on the beach, or take
a 5 minute power nap when I’m tired, or just doing nothing. It’s when
I’m <strong>not</strong> busy when insights and answers to complex
problems surface in my mind. I need to create space for new ideas to
come in. When, however, I’m busy, my work is boring and predictable —
<em>not</em> what defines success for a product manager.</p>
<p>When working fulltime, I tend to be most productive over weekends
when I have time to think and process the past week. By doing nothing, I
end up doing so much think-work that it is more productive than an
entire week of busy-work in the office.</p>
<p>Working remotely frees me up to think more and do less, which makes
me more productive, and happier. Win-win.</p>
<h2 id="healthier-eating-and-exercise-habits">3. Healthier eating and
exercise habits</h2>
<p>Commuting to the office and back creates a lot of time pressure, even
if your office is around the corner. I used to either end up not eating
anything for lunch, overdosing on coffee, or simply grabbing the closest
thing I can find which is usually either very unhealthy or very
expensive.</p>
<p>Working from home, however, I’ve come to love having the time to
prepare a healthy breakfast and the facilities to cook a decent meal for
lunch. The saved energy and increased health makes me more likely to
feel like exercise, compounding my more healthy habits.</p>
<p>I use my daily home yoga routine as a physical switch that separates
my work day from my non-work day. As a result I am much healthier and
thus can think more clearly and have more energy. My productivity at
work increased as a result because I’m much better able to focus on the
work at hand and regulate my stress better.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-connect-remotely">How to connect remotely</h1>
<p>Knowing some of the key benefits of working remotely, let’s move on
to the <em>real</em> topic at hand, namely how to connect remotely.
Being tool agnostic and focusing on the human aspect of relationships
which can be applied in any type of environment, here are my top tips
for building and strengthening online relationships.</p>
<h2 id="include-a-topic-that-doesnt-involve-work-at-all">1. Include a
topic that doesn’t involve work at all</h2>
<p>My first rule of thumb is that whenever I have a call with someone,
especially new contacts, we first talk about something that doesn’t
involve any work at all.</p>
<p>Human-to-human conversation to just get to know someone first, like
we do when we’re on holiday or in a relaxed setting where we
spontaneously engage in conversation with someone we don’t know yet.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2F1J47w3WnRmAvmUraLf%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F1J47w3WnRmAvmUraLf%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F1J47w3WnRmAvmUraLf%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy">Doggy
Shrugs off Best Friend for Food - GIPHY Clips</a></p>
<p>You don’t build relationships by only focusing on the transaction at
hand. And if there’s no relationship, there’s no sustainability from a
business perspective. <em>People stay loyal to the relationship, not the
transaction.</em></p>
<p>It’s surprisingly easy to find something to talk about. All you need
to do is pay attention a little more to the sounds, images and comments
around you during the conversation.</p>
<p>You can easily start a conversation by commenting about a background
picture someone uses. Or you could respond to the background sound of a
pet and talk about that. Or use the interruption of a child to find out
more about the other person’s family life. Or simply ask curious
questions.</p>
<p>The easiest method though is just to start talking about something
personal about yourself. The other person will reciprocate and soon you
will feel more connected than before.</p>
<p>We have a lot more in common than we would like to believe and being
in a home environment makes it so much easier to get to know the human
behind the colleague.</p>
<h2 id="dont-schedule-every-meeting">2. Don’t schedule every
meeting</h2>
<p>I’m always surprised to hear how <em>un</em>-common this approach to
managing time is. Most people I speak to tend to schedule most to all
remote conversations.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FdVi4ORMGSYfS7jR3nF%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FdVi4ORMGSYfS7jR3nF%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FdVi4ORMGSYfS7jR3nF%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy">Calendar

<p>In an office, though, you don’t only talk to your co-workers when
there’s a meeting scheduled, so why would you do it in an online
environment?</p>
<p>My rule of thumb is that I only schedule meetings when external
customers are involved; more than two people needed in a conversation;
or it is a regular check-in like a goal setting on a Monday.</p>
<p>The rest of the conversations are fluid. It happens when it is
required and with the people needed to make a good decision.</p>
<p>Practically, it usually starts with a casual chat conversation. When
it gets too lengthy or confusing, we pick up the phone. When we need
another person to join, we simply ping them in chat and include them in
the meeting.</p>
<p>But not all conversations happens now, and often you need to continue
a discussion or follow up. I also leave these invitations very open.
Rather than specifying a time and date, I rather say let’s chat
tomorrow, or tomorrow afternoon, leaving some space for movement. I then
monitor your status to know when you’re available, and in a chat ask if
you’re available for a chat when you are.</p>
<p>This approach takes the pressure off having to manage a schedule,
which is especially hard in Microsoft Teams where there are no
notifications at all.</p>
<h2 id="chat-regularly-with-small-conversations">3. Chat regularly with
small conversations</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb I check-in first thing in the morning with all my
direct team members with a simple good morning and some small talk over
virtual coffee, the same as I would do in a normal office.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FfSqHcgacuhxzuAM1ie%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FfSqHcgacuhxzuAM1ie%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FfSqHcgacuhxzuAM1ie%2Fgiphy-downsized-large.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy">Cat

<p>It’s an organic conversation that sometimes is about how grumpy the
developer is and why, other times about an urgent bug fix that needs to
be looked at, other times a simple one liner of “Good morning!” or a
funny gif to communicate how I feel.</p>
<p>During the day, we connect regularly with each other with “small”
conversations and questions. Sometimes it’s a one-liner. Other times it
starts with a simple question and continue in a video call.</p>
<p><strong><em>It’s about frequency more than
duration.</em></strong></p>
<p>Keeping the connections alive are much easier than trying to
re-connect after a long time of not talking. The more frequently you
talk to each other, the easier it is to ask for help and stay
aligned.</p>
<p><strong><em>The issues start happening when people rely on tools and
meetings as only or main communication channel.</em></strong></p>
<p>These small, regular conversations approach mean we rarely need long
conversations or meetings. We correct errors close to real-time rather
than wait for the next scheduled workshops, meaning that the quality of
the code and the productivity both improves as a result.</p>
<h2 id="establish-and-clarify-clear-rules-of-engagement">4. Establish
and clarify clear rules of engagement</h2>
<p>One of the most common complaints I hear from remote workers is that
they feel overwhelmed with a company chat where they feel they have to
respond immediately and be active all the time to show that they’re
productive.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FpcKokTw2QIArE6AK6U%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FpcKokTw2QIArE6AK6U%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FpcKokTw2QIArE6AK6U%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy">Comedian

<p>In reality though, this means their attention is on monitoring the
chat which makes them less productive on the work they should really be
focused on. It also results in potentially a lot of important things
falling through the cracks as something that was talked about but no one
actioned and is forgotten the moment the thread moves past.</p>
<p>Instant chat is great for real-time or close to real-time
conversations. If you want it now, that’s the place to put it.
<strong><em>But everything doesn’t have to be done
now.</em></strong></p>
<p>Usually having to do something <strong><em>now</em></strong> is an
interruption which causes a delay in the delivery time of all the
items.</p>
<p>Use <em>now-requests</em> sparingly.</p>
<p>Explicitly define and agree on the communication rules for the team.
What is the expected response time in different various channels and
different teams? How do you update and use status updates within the
company? What do you do with information in a chat that needs to be
translated to a work item? What do you post in the chat vs on the
workflow tool of your choice? What are each person’s preferred
communication style, channel, frequency and time?</p>
<p>Clarify these rules of engagement to put everyone on the same page
and make sure that there are mechanisms in place to ensure that work
gets done and channels stay productive, without the unnecessary noise of
a busy chat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Remember. Time reading or responding in a chat is time
not doing</em> real <em>work.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="know-when-to-rely-on-tools-and-when-to-connect-in-person">5.
Know when to rely on tools and when to connect in person</h2>
<p>This might seem obvious, yet, I’m always surprised at how bad people
are at knowing when to use which communication channel, so here’s my
obvious guide for when to use which.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>sharing</strong> <strong>information</strong> and
relaying messages <strong>chat</strong> is perfect.</li>
<li>For ensuring all <strong>standard</strong> <strong>work</strong>
items gets done rely on the <strong>tools</strong> and the
<strong>processes</strong> in place.</li>
<li>For communicating process <strong>changes</strong>,
<strong>important</strong> <strong>messages</strong> and making
<strong>decisions</strong>, <strong>team</strong>
<strong>meetings</strong> are great and following it up with a chat
ideal. But the in-person communication is the essential part, with the
chat follow-up the optional one, not the other way around.</li>
<li>For <strong>problem</strong> <strong>solving</strong> or dealing
with <strong>complex</strong> <strong>tasks</strong> (complex being
something that is not standard and straight forward, not necessarily
just difficult options), connect in a <strong>voice</strong>
<strong>call</strong> (with or without video and screen share) and
follow up with a chat.</li>
<li>For <strong>personal</strong> <strong>feedback</strong> or
<strong>negotiation</strong>, or a first time conversation with someone,
always do it <strong>face-to-face</strong> (video call with your camera
on).</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t have long conversation threads in chat. Don’t make important
decisions or convey important information in chat. Don’t ever rely on
the tool or written down tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the right communication at the right time to solve the right
problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People aren’t stupid, we just think differently, have different
skills and backgrounds and seniority. What you might think is common
sense as a one-liner instruction in a Jira task, might have multiple
interpretations by the person needing to do the work.</p>
<p><strong><em>It’s always more expensive to correct misunderstandings
at the end than take 5 minutes to explain something in person. Click the
dial button and have a voice interaction.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="add-music">6. Add music</h2>
<p>Sounds simple, but there’s nothing as awkward as an awkward silence.
Especially online where everyone is scared that they might interrupt
someone else.</p>
<p>Music not only breaks this silence and relax the participants, it has
a special, unspoken about magic ingredient that bonds people together.
By listening to the same music, our bio rhythms start synchronizing to
the beat of the music and when everyone in the room is syncing to the
same rhythm, people are subconsciously more connected than without
music.</p>
<h2 id="mob-together">7. Mob together</h2>
<p>And the grand finale, worthy for a post in itself and the default for
me, do it together.</p>
<p>Mob design, mob program, and <a

test</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Together is always better.</em></strong></p>
<p>And it’s more fun.</p>
<p>When you schedule workshops for the whole cross-functional team to
work together, magic happens. When you add an element of fun and turn it
into an RPG, work becomes play. And when work becomes play, productivity
increases so much that teams start over delivering that they soon run
out of jobs-to-be-done. A problem most companies would love to have.</p>
<p>If you are a sceptic and think it can’t possibly be productive, watch
this interview with Dan Puckett below by the Mob Mentality crew.</p>

in Scrum: How could this Possibly be Efficient? with Dan Puckett</a></p>
<p>Whether you call it mobbing, swarming or ensemble
<fill-in-the-blank>, tapping into the collective intelligence and having
a real-time cross-functional team working on the same problem at the
same time, only has benefits.</p>
<p>It reduces wait time; it increases the speed of decision making; it
reduces work-in-progress; it limits and supports bottlenecks in
real-time; it improves relationships; it improves knowledge-sharing; it
increases quality; it is more engaging; it increases flow; it improves
collaboration; it reduces procrastination; it teaches communication,
respect, boundaries and discipline.</p>
<p>And of course, it’s more fun.</p>

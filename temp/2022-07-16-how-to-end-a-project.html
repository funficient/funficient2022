<p>I’m not good at endings. In fact, I really suck at it. At work as
well as in my personal life. I’m not that great with beginnings either.
I’m only good at <strong><em>now</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Beginnings and endings are just so, complicated. The
uncomfortable-ness of getting to know each other, not sure about the
political, religious, and any other views of the team. Whether it’s
acceptable to say ’f*ck’ (which on average I don’t but when I’m really
angry I do) or if it’s ok to wear slops and a summer dress to work.</p>
<p>Endings are even worse. Because then you know what you’re saying good
bye to. With beginnings, at least you don’t yet know whether it’s going
to be a good, average or bad experience ahead. With endings, you know
what you’re losing. Good or bad, it leaves a void for while. An
emptiness.</p>
<p>I once had a friend who understood that I can’t say good bye. We
agreed that we would never say good bye, because we both know how
painful it is. We had a secret sentence we shared that meant <em>“I love
you and I miss you already and you will always, always, always be my
best friend.”</em> It sounded like this: <em>“See you for tea tomorrow
morning!”</em> Both knowing tomorrow we will be in separate places and
we won’t see each other.</p>
<h1 id="project-close-out">Project close-out</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, these kind of good byes (and beginnings) don’t really
work well at work. The most successful projects I worked on had strong
beginnings and strong endings. Clarity and focus at the start.
Resolution and a sense of completion at the end.</p>
<p><em>So how do you have a strong ending for a project, sprint or
release? A big milestone?</em></p>
<p>Here’s some pointers on what works for me:</p>
<h2 id="what-have-we-achieved">1. What have we achieved?</h2>
<p>When I was at school we received a grade report and certificate to
mark the end of the year. It was something tangible that shows the
context of effort invested over a long period and your individual
progress. It showed visually the skills you mastered.</p>
<p>Big projects happen in small increments. It sometimes takes years
with people coming and going as the project progresses. Often, we forget
how much we’ve done and how hard we worked. Taking the time to review
the achievements is extremely motivating and satisfying.</p>
<p>The tangibility of the report card or certificate at school is a form
of closure that helps us move on. Tangibly represent the project
achievements within context.</p>
<p><em>Visually draw the system as it was at the onset of the project
and indicate the improvements and additions.</em></p>
<h2 id="draw-a-history-map">2. Draw a history map</h2>
<p>I once saw an excellent theater production that deeply touched me. It
started by representing humanity as we are today — bombarded with
sensual inputs, busy beyond what is good for us, and technology keeping
us from connecting with those around us. The show progressed by going
back in time, until the beginning, when it was quiet, slow, connected
and peaceful. It had an unexpectedly powerful effect on me —this simple
moving back in time. It subconsciously reminded me of what live should
be like. What I secretly yearn for.</p>
<p>After this show, I systematically slowed down, quit social media and
started working less and living more. To this day I’m amazed at the
effect that this moving back in time had on me.</p>
<p>By virtue of looking back — whether in our personal lives or on a
work project — we get closure which allows us to move forward and remind
us of our intent.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://gamestorming.com/history-map/">history map</a> is
a good way to start a project, but also a very good way to reflect back
on a project and show all the ups and downs at the close-down of a
project. It’s a simple technique to acknowledge each person in the team
and give them time to reflect.</p>
<p>Draw a timeline on a board with key dates. Invite each person in the
team to add a dot on the line when they joined, and elaborate on the
highs and lows of the project as well as the major milestones throughout
the project.</p>
<p>Let the map do the talking. Allow the story to unfold as each person
shares their involvement and learning.</p>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learned">3. What have we learned?</h2>
<p><em>Another great way to end a project or collaboration is to have a
show-and-tell where each team member gets a few minutes to share or
present what they have learned or contributed to the team during a
project.</em></p>
<p>Maybe they did something small like clean up all the bugs that’s been
lying around for year. Maybe they did something bigger like introduce
the use of mock interfaces to streamline integration testing. Maybe they
introduced a new technology or applied an old technology in a new
way.</p>
<p>Give each person the opportunity to showcase how they contributed to
the team and celebrate their success.</p>
<h2 id="share-your-biggest-failure">4. Share your biggest failure</h2>
<p>Another, more personal approach that requires a high degree of trust
in the team is to share failures. There is something extremely rewarding
in sharing what went wrong. How you failed.</p>
<p>Actually, there’s a whole movement called <a
href="https://fuckupnights.com">f*upnights</a> where people are invited
and applauded for sharing their failures.</p>
<p>When you are able to share how you messed up it makes you human.
Approachable. Normal.</p>
<p>We too often look at role models expecting them to be perfect. That
is like expecting all women to look like super models and all men to be
super hero’s.</p>
<p>In real life, real people make mistakes. No one is perfect. Greatness
comes from having the courage to try again after you’ve failed.
Admitting that you made a mistake. Owning it. It’s not about the
mistake. It’s what you do <strong><em>after</em></strong> the mistake
that matters. When you <strong><em>own</em></strong> your mistakes,
you’re accountable and you’re help-able.</p>
<p>People have much more respect for those willing to admit their
vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">5. What’s next?</h2>
<p>Finally, the last part of a strong project closure is to decide
what’s next. Maybe it means that the project is officially finished and
all the resources are free to walk away. Maybe it is identifying an area
that might result in a new, different project in the future. Maybe it is
a definitive rest period before a future, unkown project.</p>
<p>The key is to be explicit. Clearly state what the future holds, even
if it means you don’t know. Expectation is everything.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>Until next time that is.</p>
<p><em>See you for tea tomorrow morning!</em></p>

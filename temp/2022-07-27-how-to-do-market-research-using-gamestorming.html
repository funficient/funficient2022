<h2 id="an-interactive-and-fun-approach-to-user-centered-design">An
interactive and fun approach to user-centered design</h2>
<p><em>“How do you create a product or service that users want? How do
you understand the needs and get buy-in from a community that you don’t
belong to?”</em></p>
<p>These were the two main questions driving our first in a series of
market research workshops with the aim to launch a Business Development
Center in a local township in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>The <em>vision</em> behind the center is to <strong>connect</strong>
and <strong>empower</strong> the local, currently disadvantaged
community through <strong>business</strong>. The dream is to create
social entrepreneurs who view problems as opportunities to start a
profitable business. Uplifting while empowering.</p>
<p><em>The challenge?</em> Finding the balance between philanthropy and
empowerment as an outsider, with the understanding that doing something
for someone doesn’t necessarily empower them. Many non-profits fail
because they come in with a solution that worked for them or their
culture without first understanding the challenges and needs of the
community they are trying to help. Ernesto Sirolli concisely explains
the problem in his <a
href="https://www.ted.com/talks/ernesto_sirolli_want_to_help_someone_shut_up_and_listen">TED
talk</a> below:</p>

<p><a

<p>We decided to heed to Ernesto’s sound advice and spent the first few
weeks doing market research in a series of workshops aimed to increase
awareness, build a following and get buy-in from the community, while
asking them what they need and listening to what they want with an open
mind.</p>
<h1 id="crafting-a-user-experience-journey">Crafting a User Experience
Journey</h1>
<p>The first step in our approach to market research using <a
href="http://gamestorming.com/">gamestorming</a> was to create context
and focus by introducing the main topic for the day, carefully chosen
based on our bigger vision going forward.</p>
<p><img

<p>User Journey Creation</p>
<p>Following the lean startup model, our first goal is to create and
establish a learning environment where people can find the information
they are looking for in the form of an internet cafe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge is power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a quick warmup and introduction, we spent a few minutes
<strong><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/brainwriting/">brainwriting</a></strong>
everything a user could think of doing and wanting in an Internet Cafe.
Each person silently wrote down all their ideas on sticky notes and
posted it on a pre-compiled user-journey outlining the main phases of
the user-journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insight #1</strong> — The majority of the audience doesn’t
currently have access to a smartphone or other device to access the
internet. They had no idea what an internet cafe should look like.</p>
<p>Initially we thought this was a disadvantage and that we should have
first provided more context as to the current “what-is” before launching
into the future, but soon afterwards realized that this was what gave us
an edge and differentiated this internet cafe from everything else
currently out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*KC49hWbO8H0fiTtn6-5UaA.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Empathy mapping and bodystorming</p>
<p>Next we split the group into two, with one group becoming the actors
in a <strong><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/bodystorming/">bodystorming</a></strong>
session, while the other group took notes on an <strong><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/empathy-mapping/">empathy map</a></strong>
while observing.</p>
<p>Knowing that the community doesn’t have any prior expectation and use
of an internet cafe, a pre-prepared possible user scenario written on a
piece of paper was handed out randomly throughout the bodystorming
session and the actors had to improvise a solution to this problem or
event posed to them.</p>
<p>Afterwards everyone was gathered in a circle and invited to share
their insights and discuss what is needed to make this business a
success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Insight #2</strong> — The random inputs (a De Bono
thinking method) not only made the bodystorming more engaging and fun,
but aided the thinking process immensely, making it an extremely useful
tool.</em></p>
<p>Most of the new insights were as a result of these unexpected events
rather than the planned events and mapped out user journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a good idea of what a successful Internet Cafe business will
look like and some food for thought on what business challenges might be
encountered in such an environment, we took a coffee break while
continuing the discussion.</p>
<p><img

<p>Brainwriting and dot-voting</p>
<p>While the first part of the workshop was dedicated to figuring out
what the space will look like, the final part of the workshop focused on
figuring out what the contents of the space should be.</p>
<p>The group was asked to write down everything they want to learn on
sticky notes while posing questions such as <em>“What are you interested
in?” “What skill do you want to develop?” “What do you want to
learn?”</em>.</p>
<p>Each person was invited to post his or her ideas on the board and
briefly explained where needed. Finally, each person was allocated 3
voting tokens and asked to vote for the items they were most interested
in using the <strong><a
href="http://gamestorming.com/dot-voting/">dot-voting</a></strong>
method.</p>
<h1 id="the-outcome-and-conclusion">The Outcome and Conclusion</h1>
<p>What came out of the workshop was a unique concept for an internet
cafe and a comprehensive and clear list of topics the community wanted
to learn to develop themselves.</p>
<p>It was surprising how simple yet different the concept was for the
internet cafe. Looking obvious, I looked at all the internet cafe’s
around and none of the met the blueprint created by the group —
consisting of a combination of fulfilling basic needs to allow the the
time and space to spend behind a computer, and the nice-to-have’s which
is the difference between going there vs. going elsewhere for a similar
service.</p>
<p>It was also surprising how there was a lot of interest in various
topics, yet two main topics stood out clearly as a basic need, allowing
us to focus on the core offering that should form part of the starting
phase of the internet cafe.</p>
<p><em>Within a few hours we went from a blank slate to a very clearly
defined value proposition. Using traditional methods where customers are
interviewed, a lot of time is spent on research and teams working in
isolation, “hiding” the proposed service or product offering during the
initial phases, our collaborative, inclusive approach using gamestorming
not only shortened the time needed for a needs analysis, but also
ensured alignment with the target market and the ability to do an
immediate user validation as part of the process of defining the user
journey and concept.</em></p>

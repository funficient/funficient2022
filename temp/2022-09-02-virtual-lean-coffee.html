    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

Collaboration, Performance Appraisals and Shorter Meetings</h2>
<p><em>Meetings can be boring, yet, they are a very necessary evil. It’s
essential for collaboration, team alignment and communication. But what
if you don’t have all the people in one room? What if one person takes
up all the talk time? How do you engage people remotely?</em></p>
<p>These were some of the questions we attempted to answer in a recent
virtual <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/The-Idea-Hackathon/events/239010023/">Meetup</a>
arranged by the team behind <a
href="http://www.theideahackathon.co.za/">The Idea Hackathon</a> and
this is the meeting minutes (image below).</p>

Agile.</p>
<h2
id="performance-appraisals-should-it-stay-or-should-it-go">Performance
Appraisals — Should it stay or should it go?</h2>
<p>The first topic for discussion was on a subject I’m very passionate
about, namely performance appraisals.</p>
<p>The question was posed whether there might be a better way to handle
performance appraisals other than the traditional formal sit-down every
6–12 month interval to determine your raise, bonus or both.</p>
<p>We started by looking at the purpose of appraisals, which is to give
feedback to employees in order to get better performance from the teams.
Collectively, we came up with the following insights:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Performance appraisals should be done on a continuous, informal
basis as relaxed conversations, not formal sit-down to discuss measures
and metrics.</li>
<li>Monetary reward should not be linked to performance appraisals.</li>
<li>Feedback should be multi-dimensional, coming from different people
you interact with, it shouldn’t be a one-sided conversation. It should
at least include your peers, ideally, everyone you have interacted with
during the project or task.</li>
<li>Focus on strengths, not improvement areas and how you were
<em>not</em> meeting expectations.</li>
<li>Don’t rate talented recruits as average, even when they are average
among their peers. They’re not. They’re exceptional. Just because
they’re part of team awesome, doesn’t make them less awesome. Rather
focus on their specific superpower, making them feel like an individual
rather than the average sum of brainpower in the organization.</li>
<li>Introduce drastic or paradigm changes as an evolutionary process
rather than a big-bang project, starting with the leadership team and
cascading downward. In retrospect, the waterfall approach wasn’t
<em>all</em> bad.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="team-building-remotely">Team building remotely</h2>
<p>The next topic was around building and strengthening teams remotely.
We aimed to answer questions such as how do you leverage technology to
improve the remote experience? How do you engage people virtually?</p>
<p>The insights we came up with were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find a way to <em>not</em> be remote, or try to be less remote. What
ways can you find to limit remote sessions, at least team remote
sessions?</li>
<li>Define a team agreement with basic rules, including hand signs that
can be used in sessions. Have a sign for typical irritations or problems
within the team, like one person talking too much, or someone not
speaking up enough to be heard.</li>
<li>An alternative to hand-signs can be to use pre-printed cards. <a
href="http://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/supercards/">Collaboration
Supercards</a> allows for suggestions without interrupting, like “you’re
on mute” or “enough, let’s move on”. Another implementation would be to
create cards with adjectives only, describing how you feel about
discussions, people, things etc. Personally, I use pen and paper and
hold it up against the camera.</li>
<li>One of my personal favorites, make use of collaborative exercises
like <a href="http://gamestorming.com/">gamestorming</a> techniques for
more engaging meetings rather than merely discussing topics verbally.
Lean coffee is a prime example of how to do this.</li>
<li>Have good technology. Technology should be an enabler, enhancing the
experience, so it is important that people use the right technology for
the right purpose.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="balancing-talk-time-in-meetings">Balancing talk time in
meetings</h2>
<p>The last topic aimed to answer the following questions “How to deal
with people who take up all the bandwidth in a meeting?” and “ How to
keep meetings short and interesting?”.</p>
<p>Here are the insights we came up with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Everything starts with awareness. Make everyone in the meeting aware
of the amount of time they spoke during the meeting by showing them a
breakdown of the talk-time by each person.</li>
<li>Intentionally keep quiet or give the least possible amount of
necessary information to serve as role model for others to (hopefully)
follow.</li>
<li>Take the time to get to know each other’s communication styles and
try to accommodate it.</li>
<li><em>Make use of the technique called “Bottom lining”, which is
basically starting the conversation with the end result or state, and
then only filling in any blanks that brought you to the point.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/336/1*W03-5pkYV-rafAYJgRFKWw.png" /></p>
<p>This brought up the question of how to convince teams to spend time
on perceived ‘unproductive’ work like communication styles and lead to
the graph showing the return on investment when investing 1 hour per day
with the aim to improve 1% productivity.</p>
<p>Break-even point is after only 1 month after which the improvements
exponentially grow, resulting in far more than the intended 1%
improvement. This should be enough motivation to convince most managers
to invest in less productive work for the team.</p>
<h2 id="full-circle">Full circle</h2>
<p>The final topic took us full-circle back to where we started, ending
with discussing how generic job descriptions and performance appraisals
cause disengaged employees.</p>
<p>We briefly took a trip down memory lane remembering why job
descriptions was invented, coming to the realization that during the
industrial revolution the measure of quality was how precisely you could
reproduce the same article. In the age of knowledge workers, however,
quality is measured by the uniqueness and innovation of each product or
service offering. Generic job descriptions thus doesn’t make sense and
doesn’t support creativity or individuality.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Learning, however, is in the pause between the in-breath and the
out-breath. The retrospective is when things fall into the right
compartments inside your brain that allows you to act differently going
forward.</p>
<p>Taking the time to contemplate my learning from the collaboration as
a retrospective writing this post shed another powerful and obvious
insight we all missed during the call.</p>
<p>The method of lean coffee itself is a powerful tool to shorten
meetings. I would probably not have realized this without the
collaboration and the physical act of participating in the virtual lean
coffee myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Words don’t teach. The learning is in the doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So my question to you is what are <em>you</em> doing differently?
What are you learning right now? What insights or ideas do you have to
add?</p>

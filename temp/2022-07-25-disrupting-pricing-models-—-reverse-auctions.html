    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="tipping-the-balance-between-demand-and-supply">Tipping the
balance between demand and supply</h2>
<p>Most companies and people have a set price and determine their
offering based on their time and level of expertise. Their product is
sold in a set price list that people can look at to decide whether they
can afford it or not.</p>
<p>The <strong>benefit</strong> of this approach to both the consumer
and the supplier is that people who can’t afford your services are
filtered out before contacting you while customers don’t spend
unnecessary time and money pursuing an offer they don’t know yet doesn’t
fall into their budget.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like walking past a restaurant and looking at the menu
before asking for a table rather than sitting down immediately only to
discover that there is no vegetarian options available or that it is too
expensive for what you had in mind. It’s a win-win for both parties.</p>
<p>The <strong>downside</strong> of this approach, however, is that an
opportunity for bartering which might result in a much better value
proposition is lost. You are locked into a set profit margin regardless
of the context or situation.</p>
<h2 id="money-is-not-the-only-currency">Money is not the only
currency</h2>
<p>Money, as a tool for value exchange, is a globally accepted and
accessible tool that allows you to buy anything regardless of whether
what you do has any value to the recipient.</p>
<p>In the days before money, goods were exchanged and — as an example —
if you, as a carpenter, wanted a pair of shoes but the shoemaker didn’t
want carpentry done, you were stuck and unable to get the shoes. Money
solved that problem by being a general resource accepted by
everyone.</p>
<p>However, in the old days there were no tax laws either, no banks with
high bank fees and no currency exchange rules making it less and less
viable to use money as a currency for exchange.</p>
<p>The origin of taxes (not land-ownership taxes but mandatory tax on
income by government) came from a need within the community to better
the standard of living for the community at large. When there was a need
for war the rand lords were asked for a voluntary contribution to fund
the venture. Only much later was it decided that taxes should become a
mandatory contribution by the working class. The more it became the
rule, the less it seemed to be used for the welfare of the people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how do you get more bang for your buck? How do you get more value
with less money being spent? How do you afford things you think you’re
not able to afford?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is routed in another question. <em>What do you intend to
do with the money and how do you cut out this middle man?</em></p>
<h1 id="reverse-auction-as-pricing-model">Reverse Auction as Pricing
Model</h1>
<p>A problem with volunteering and the art of allowing as described in
<a
href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-disruptive-new-pricing-model-7ab16011025c">A
Disruptive New Pricing Model</a> is that not having a set price list can
be very intimidating for the recipient of the service.</p>
<p>How much should they pay if you ask them for a donation? What is the
going rate for something similar? Would it offend the recipient if you
paid too little?</p>
<p>To make it less intimidating for both sides, the concept of a reverse
auction as pricing model can be a great solution to the problem.</p>
<p>This is how it works.</p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-outcome-not-the-process">1. Focus on the outcome,
not the process</h2>
<p>As consumer, contact the service provider and make an offer based on
your budget. Be very explicit about what you need and what the problem
is you are about to solve. Refrain from getting too specific about
<em>what</em> you want or <em>how</em> you want it delivered and rather
focus on <em>why</em> you want it.</p>
<p>For example, you want a gamestorming workshop because you want an
innovative idea that will make you more marketable is a better request
than asking for someone to facilitate a lean coffee. A lean coffee might
be what you need, but more often than not it’s not going to solve the
problem.</p>
<p>Don’t ask for a tri-fold flyer design with a list of everything that
must be on it and specifying that it must be done in Microsoft
Publisher. Offer the available resources but don’t force it. Allow the
designer to ask for what they need in order to deliver what you want.
Maybe Microsoft Publisher is not the best tool to use and maybe the
information that you provided doesn’t bring the correct message across
to help you solve your problem.</p>
<p>Rather state your problem and that you would like a flyer to raise
awareness of a specific problem, or sell a specific product etc. without
going into the mechanics of how this problem is to be solved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The problem can not be solved on the same level as what it was
created on.” — Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re paying for the expertise of the specialist, leave it up to
them to solve the problem. Spend your effort in explaining the problem
and the impact of the problem and let them see how best they can solve
it.</p>
<h2 id="make-an-offer">2. Make an offer</h2>
<p>Once you’ve explained the problem you need to solve and the
end-result you wish to obtain, make an offer to the service
provider.</p>
<p>Be creative. Offer money (because money does pay the bills in the end
of the day) but also include other things that might be valuable to
them, such as the use of the building after hours, the ability to use
some of your services or exposure to their brand. Ask the following
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you have in excess or abundance?</li>
<li>What don’t you use optimally that can be shared?</li>
<li>What do you have that you actually have no need for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Come up with a unique offer that is as valuable to you as to the
service provider.</p>
<h2 id="service-provider-sets-the-terms">3. Service provider sets the
terms</h2>
<p>Once the offer is made, the service provider <em>has</em> to accept
the offer but they also have the right to set the terms. How much time
are they willing to spend? How frequently will they engage? What
artifacts and resources are they willing to contribute?</p>
<p>For example, based on the offer made — and taking the desired outcome
into consideration — the service provider will decide that they are only
willing to spend 3 hours and not 5 on a gamestorming workshop or that
you have to provide the sticky notes and coffee.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Money is not the only currency and paths are made by walking. Rather
than following in the path of everyone that came before you, try
different pricing models that will allow you to get more value for
money.</p>
<p>Disrupt by offering reverse auctions to get what you want. <em>Want
to try it? Make an offer!</em></p>

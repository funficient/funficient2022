<h2 id="how-to-get-teams-talking">How to Get Teams Talking</h2>
<p>In a previous post I touched on the loss of information between teams
as one of <a
href="https://everydayagile.com/the-biggest-waste-in-agile-e8925c3ec512">the
biggest causes of waste in agile</a>. This post aims to focus on the
<em>solution</em> to reduce the loss of communication.</p>
<p>First, let me provide some context.</p>
<p>You are about to go on a well-deserved and long overdue holiday. You
feel relaxed and look forward to spending some time with your family.
All that needs to be done before you can leave is a final handover to
make sure nothing falls through the cracks while you’re gone. Your team
is more than competent and your manager knows you’ve spent a lot of time
making sure your tea knows what needs to be done while you’re gone.</p>
<p>You go on holiday with a light heart, expecting to come back to a
productive and happy team with all the work done.</p>
<p>Soon after you’re gone, however, your manager — a micro-manager and
control freak — goes to a resource in a different team whom she trusts —
let’s call him Jim — and with good intention asks him to make sure the
work gets done.</p>
<p>Jim, an eager and hands-on resource, however, causes conflict and
confusion when he takes over the tasks the other team is busy with. He
feels uncomfortable and out of place, yet is eager to show his manager
what a valuable resource he is and continues doing the task his way.
Meanwhile, the team is upset, feeling redundant and incompetent and not
understanding why they are not being trusted to do the work. A tug of
war erupts with both sides trying to keep their individual line managers
happy.</p>
<p>With two teams now responsible for the same task, things suddenly
start falling apart with one person starting a task just to find out
that someone else is also working on it causing errors in the build when
trying to deploy the work to the production branch of code.</p>
<p>Both teams feel unhappy and resentment starts growing. After two
weeks you return to an unhappy, demotivated team with the work not done,
or at least not as good as you expected it to be done. You don’t
understand what went wrong…</p>
<h1 id="the-bad-and-the-ugly-about-communication">The bad and the ugly
about communication</h1>
<p>If this scenario seems familiar, your organization — like most
organizations I’ve encountered — suffers from communication
breakdown.</p>
<p>As a result of crossed lines of communication between different teams
or resources, work supposed to be done within a week by one team now
takes two or even three weeks or longer with two or more teams involved,
increasing the cost of production by 300% or more while customer
satisfaction ratings are going down and the sales and customer support
team’s workload is being impacted by the lower quality work.</p>
<p>So here’s some ugly truths about communication that you might or
might not know.</p>
<h2 id="truth-1-people-hear-what-they-want-to-hear">Truth #1: People
hear what they want to hear</h2>
<p><em>Each person will have or make their own assumptions based on
their own beliefs and knowledge and experience. The one thing you can be
sure of is what you said is not what was heard.</em></p>
<h2 id="truth-2-less-is-more">Truth #2: Less is more</h2>
<p>Confusion happens when you get conflicting messages from two
different sides. Realize that every time you increase the number of
people in a line of communication, the message gets diluted.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="truth-3-too-many-cooks-spoil-the-broth">Truth #3: Too many cooks
spoil the broth</h2>
<p>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos recommends that team meetings should consist of
no more people than can be fed on two pizzas. Involving more people in a
meeting or task does not result in better communication or faster
results. Rather, it introduces more complexity and confusion.</p>
<h2 id="truth-4-noise-is-everywhere">Truth #4: Noise is everywhere</h2>
<p>In a psychology experiment two designers are asked to design
something for a client. He already has something that he came up with,
and would like to compare it with the designers’ work. The designers,
priding themselves in the originality of their work, is shocked and
surprised when they present their concept and it is a near exact match
to the client’s concept. Here is the full video:</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZyQjr1YL0zg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZyQjr1YL0zg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZyQjr1YL0zg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube">Derren
Brown - Subliminal Advertising</a></p>
<p>How did this happen? The taxi ride to the client was designed
intentionally to drive past certain artifacts that influenced their
final design so much that it was a near exact match.</p>
<h2 id="truth-5-you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know.">Truth #5: You don’t
know what you don’t know.</h2>
<p>The one thing you can be sure of when embarking on a new task is that
you don’t know what is going to happen in the future and you don’t have
all the answers. If you did, you would have planned for it.</p>
<h1 id="what-it-takes-to-get-your-message-across">What it takes to get
your message across</h1>
<h2 id="rule-1-think-more-say-less.">Rule # 1: Think more, say
less.</h2>
<p>Don’t think out loud. Good communication is lean communication. 80%
of communication is non-verbal. One word or sentence often has more
impact than an hour long speech. Spend more time figuring out what you
want to say and why, less time talking.</p>
<h2 id="rule-2-deal-with-the-interference.">Rule # 2: Deal with the
interference.</h2>
<p>Protect your team with clear boundaries and responsibilities. Not to
be confused with red tape.</p>
<p>Be sure that your team knows who they can ask for clarity while
you’re away. Make sure that only one person takes final responsibility.
Make sure that the task is explicit.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-go-direct.">Rule #3: Go direct.</h2>
<p>Cut out the middleman. Never, ever, EVER rely on a messenger to
deliver a message. Ever.</p>
<p>One of the principles of agile software development is that the best
form of communication is face-to-face communication.</p>
<p>Have a one-to-one relationship between responsible and accountable.
Reduce the number of different authority lines. Give direct
responsibility to each person or team and hold only them accountable for
the results.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-focus-on-the-results.">Rule #4: Focus on the
results.</h2>
<p>Each person has a different style and different skills. What is easy
for you might not be easy for someone else. As opposed to making sure
that the team knows <strong><em>how</em></strong> to do a task, focus on
<strong><em>what</em></strong> you want the <strong>end-result</strong>
to be. What does success look like?</p>
<p>Be very explicit about what needs to be done, who will be held
responsible, when it needs to be done, who needs to be informed and what
to do when there is an issue.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-provide-context.">Rule #5: Provide context.</h2>
<p>One of the best tools I’ve encountered as a business analyst is
context diagrams. A simple diagram consisting of a bunch of boxes to
indicate the different subsystems or functions, connected with lines
labelled with at least a verb and a noun to explicitly define the
purpose of the relationship between two functions. It works because it
simplifies complexity and provides context as to how one task or team
influences the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Visualize work to provide context with a simple drawing on a white
board, a Kanban board, a task list or a context diagram.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-only-give-one-person-final-responsibility.">Rule #6: Only
give one person final responsibility.</h2>
<p>There’s an old story on responsibility by an unknown author which
best describes this rule. It goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an important job to be done and <strong>Everybody</strong>
was sure that <strong>Somebody</strong> would do it.
<strong>Anybody</strong> could have done it, but <strong>Nobody</strong>
did it.</p>
<p><strong>Somebody</strong> got angry about that because it was
<strong>Everybody</strong>’s job. <strong>Everybody</strong> thought
that <strong>Anybody</strong> could do it, but <strong>Nobody</strong>
realized that <strong>Everybody</strong> wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p>It ended up that <strong>Everybody</strong> blamed
<strong>Somebody</strong> when <strong>Nobody</strong> did what
<strong>Anybody</strong> could have done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moral of the story is that if you want something done, give
responsibility to <strong><em>one</em></strong> person only and make
sure that everybody knows who is responsible.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7-kill-the-grapevine">Rule #7: Kill the Grapevine</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest cause of issues in organizations are the
grapevine. People relying on information from peers rather than going
direct.</p>
<p>Don’t be too busy or unapproachable for people to ask you when they
have questions and never make someone feel as if their question is
stupid. Even if you think it is a stupid question, it takes maybe a few
seconds to answer and clarify something compared to hours of even days
of resolving an issues as a result of misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Make it safe for people to ask when they are uncertain and create a
culture of open and honest communication.</p>
<h2 id="rule-8-watch-your-tone">Rule #8: Watch your Tone</h2>
<p>Thank you. Please. Good work.</p>
<p>It’s free and it only takes a few seconds, yet is the single most
powerful tool to increase productivity.</p>
<p>When you speak in a loud, aggressive voice, the recipient is more
likely to be defensive, thinking of how to justify themselves rather
than spending the time listening to what you are saying. If you want
people to hear your message, soft and kind goes a long way.</p>

<h2 id="and-its-not-waiting">And it’s not waiting…</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, all development was done following a waterfall
approach, one process sequentially following the previous.</p>
<h2 id="ducks-in-a-row.">Ducks in a row….</h2>
<p>It was like a game of pass-the-message where the first person
whispered a secret message in the next person’s ear. Each subsequent
person whispered what they heard in the next person’s ear, until the
last person had to relay the message to the entire group.</p>
<p>Usually, it results in laughter when the original message gets to the
other side so distorted, often not even remotely the same as the initial
intention.</p>
<p><em>Like little ducks in a row, waterfall development similarly
contained each dependency in a well-defined box, one following the
other. Planning was done by the project managers, requirements by the
business analysts, design by the designers, and so it continued until
the product was finally ready for the customer.</em></p>
<p>It never really did work though, and agile was born.</p>
<h2 id="the-empire-strikes-again">The empire strikes again</h2>
<p>Agile was not like anything before. It didn’t have a recipe you could
follow like all the previous methodologies.</p>
<p>There are no detailed guides. There are only a set of four values,
written in a it-depends kind of way. Open to the interpretation of each
unique reader.</p>

<p>No rules, no defined processes, no hard-and-fast
<em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>Rather, it is like a game of Twister, where everything is
inter-connected with different people from distinctly different
disciplines working together to deliver an increment of the product.</p>
<p>Letting go of the defined structures we are so used to often looks as
chaotic from the outside, yet, the value of the method is the break-down
in silo’s as a result of the interconnectedness. The teams that have the
bodies entangled on the floor, are the ones to see the fun and purpose
in the game.</p>
<p>The single biggest strength of agile is that there are to be no more
secrets between different teams. No more whispering the message hoping
that the next team won’t hear it properly so that you can sit back and
have a laugh at the end of the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agile was designed to break down silo’s and enable human-to-human
communication.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, we failed miserably in most cases. We threw away the rules and
processes and red tape, but we didn’t work on the <em>one</em> thing
that agile was attempting to resolve. <em>Cross-functional
communication.</em></p>
<p>Which brings me to the title of the post — namely the biggest waste
in agile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The biggest waste in agile, is the loss of information between
different teams or functions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Each time you speak to someone other</strong> than the
person directly affected, you dilute the message. The more layers
between the original, face-to-face message and the recipient, the more
diluted it becomes.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Each time you don’t speak</strong> to someone else when
you disagree because you would rather agree than risk the discomfort of
disharmony, a piece of the puzzle is hidden, making it hard to build a
complete picture.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Each time you speak so much</strong> that no-one else has
the energy left to sit for another hour and listen, you inhibit the
creativity and growth of the entire team and cut off a part of the
picture that could have made it awesome.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Each time you don’t ask</strong> when something clearly
doesn’t make sense, because it comes from an authority figure or a
different function, you’re allowing mistakes to creep in keeping the
picture from becoming awesome. It’s like seeing a puzzle piece being put
in the wrong place but saying nothing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Each time you <em>don’t point out a dysfunction</em></strong>
in the team because you’re afraid that you’ll be fired, or ridiculed, or
hurt someone else’s feelings, you’re enabling the dysfunction to grow
bigger. <em>You consent to the dysfunction by refraining to voice your
opinion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Each time you do something that you’re not <em>proud</em> of,
or don’t <em>believe</em> in</strong>, only because you’re tired of
fighting for the product or the customer, you inhibit the entire team’s
success. And that includes you.</p>
<h2 id="trash-talk">Trash Talk</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about trash…</p>
<p>People make mistakes. All of us. The smallest, and the biggest. None
of us are perfect, and if we were, there would be little need for us to
communicate. But communication and social connection is a big reason why
you’re working in an organization and not being a solo-preneur, so don’t
discard communication as a not-so-important issue.</p>
<p>Don’t refrain from doing it differently only because that’s the way
you’ve done it before. The power is in your hands and change starts with
you.</p>

<p>So what can you do to reduce this waste?</p>
<p><strong>1 — Equal speak-time</strong></p>
<p>The easiest strategy to start with is to bring equality to the
airtime in any meeting.</p>
<p>As the agile coach, observe the team and after each meeting, show
them a breakdown of how much each person spoke during the meeting. No
judgement. Simple raise the awareness.</p>
<p><strong>2 — Speak up</strong></p>
<p>Much harder, it takes courage to speak up and say when you see a
dysfunction in the team, especially if it comes from the leader.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But speaking up is not the same as criticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Criticism is trying to make someone else look bad. Speaking up is
living in integrity. Being true to yourself, while having the best
interest of the <em>group</em> in mind.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe in what you are about to say,
<strong><em>and</em></strong> if you don’t have the best interest of the
entire group in mind — not only your own self-interest — it’s criticism.
Keep quiet.</p>
<p>Go do your homework, gather the facts, and ask yourself whether what
you are about to say is to look important, or to add value.</p>
<p><strong>3 — Support</strong></p>
<p>Two voices are stronger than one. When someone in the team raises an
issues that you feel strongly about, strengthen their voice and support
them. It’s scary to question an authority figure.</p>
<p>But, it’s much more scary being the authority figure. An authority
figure is responsible for an entire team’s wellbeing, while most team
members, take the monthly salary for granted. They are often the most
vulnerable person in the group, and far outnumbered by the team.</p>
<p><em>Support. Don’t attack.</em></p>
<p><strong>4 —Attempt to understand</strong></p>
<p>You can’t support someone if you don’t even know what their day
consists of, or what challenges they have to face. Just because it’s not
your job, doesn’t mean you can’t add value.</p>
<p>Try to understand what your colleagues need or do. I often see how
people switch off when the discussion topic is not directly related to
them. This is harmful and counter-productive.</p>
<p>The better you understand what the other person in your team does,
the easier you will make their job, and the easier your job will become
as a result.</p>
<p><strong>5 — Question your intent</strong></p>
<p>Why are you doing or saying what you are doing? Are you trying to
look good? Or are what you are about to say important and in the best
interest of the entire group?</p>
<p>Does the whole team need to hear what you have to say? Or can you
have a one-to-one after the meeting?</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The biggest waste in agile is the loss of valuable information as a
result of bad communication within teams.</p>
<p><em>Communication is not the same as talking. You don’t communicate
with anyone by speaking. You communicate when there is equal speaking
and listening.</em></p>

Work</h1>

<h2 id="an-unconventional-look-at-increasing-productivity-at-work">An
Unconventional Look at Increasing Productivity at Work</h2>
<p>It’s the start of a new year and even though I don’t believe in
setting new year’s resolutions, I catch myself sitting down and making a
list of everything I want to achieve this year.  The problem I face is
that each year my list seems to be getting longer, with more items being
carried over from the previous years.  That’s why I vowed to
<strong>stop</strong> setting new year’s resolutions a few years ago. 
That sinking feeling that I never seem to get things done, with my
bucket list getting longer and longer.</p>
<p>In all fairness, I do get a lot done.  Really a lot.  Compared to the
average person I have met in my life, I have done more and learned more
and been to more places than the vast majority.  So it’s maybe unfair to
say that I <em>never</em> reach my goals. It’s rather that I have really
big goals and a desire to do <em>everything</em>.  At least once.   In
fact, that’s my motto in life: <strong><em>“Try everything
once”</em></strong>. I’m making good progress, but it sure isn’t easy
and it does mean that I have to be as productive as humanly possible. 
Because life’s too short to rush if I want to get to everything on my
list.</p>
<p>Travel the world once.  Yes, <em>every</em> place would really be
nice.  How else would I know if there’s anywhere better than where I’ve
already been?  And I surely can’t die without seeing the Northern
Lights, climbing Machu Picchu, learn to tango in Buenos Aires, dive the
red sea and been island hopping in Greece on a private yacht?</p>
<p>Then there’s also my wish to be a barista in a coffee shop once, own
a co-working space with raw wooden tables and lots of white and natural
light, be the founder of a (successful) technology startup, write a
bestselling book, live in a French-speaking country for at least a few
years (maybe forever), learn to ski, be a yoga teacher, design a (good)
game or gamified experience, study improv theatre, walk on fire. Deep
breath.  Did I mention all the books I want to read, the art and dance
and dinner parties and conversations I still need to have? You get the
picture.  And these are only <em>some</em> of the most important items
on my bucket list.</p>
<h2 id="ambitious-or-crazy">Ambitious?  Or crazy?</h2>
<p>The problem is that you don’t write a best selling book in a year. 
Or learn a language (properly) in a year.  Or travel to all these
extraordinary places in just one year.  Or become a yoga teacher in a
year.  Honestly, I’ve been practising downward dog for the past 15 years
and I’m <em>still</em> not getting it right.</p>
<p>I usually feel a bit embarrassed when I ask other people about their
wish lists or new year’s resolutions.  I’ve only ever met one person
with close to as many ambitious goals as I do.  Most people have a
focused and conservative list of maybe 3 or 5 realistic items.  Usually,
it includes something like lose 5kg or improves my golf handicap. 
“<em>You put that on your list?  Isn’t that the same as brushing your
teeth or washing your hair regularly?”</em>  I think as they say it but
keep it to myself.  It makes me feel confused or greedy or crazy or all
of the above for wanting the things I want.</p>
<p>The thing is, over the years I’ve realized that whatever you really
set your mind to is inevitable to come true, eventually.  Just probably
not the way you thought it will happen.  It doesn’t matter how much you
earn, how old you are, where you come from, or your education. If you
really want it, you can have it.  I’ve learned not to give up on the
dream itself, but on <strong><em>how</em></strong> the dream will come
true.</p>
<p>Do you spot the problem in my thinking?  I actually don’t believe
it’s impossible to do and have all these things.  So each year my list
gets longer and each year my list of habits get longer too.  Write every
day.  Learn something new.  Move more. Do more.  <em>Live</em> more.  My
ideal day is about 72 hours long and counting.</p>
<p><em>“So what does that have to do with productivity at work?”</em>
you ask.  Good question. Thanks for asking.</p>
<h2
id="unconventional-productivity-hack-1-make-it-achievable">Unconventional
productivity hack #1 – Make it achievable</h2>
<p>The upside of my ever-growing to-do list is that I never get bored
and I can talk about pretty much anything.  It has also taught me the
art (or rather a pain) of perseverance and believing in yourself when
no-one else does.  Most importantly, it taught me an important lesson in
productivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1: The more achievable a task or project, the
higher productivity</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds obvious, right? So obvious in the fact that I feel hesitant to
explicitly mention it. Maybe because everyone else seems to get this
lesson looking at most people’s yearly resolutions compared to mine.</p>
<p>Yet, thinking back to all the large projects (and even smaller ones)
I’ve been involved in, none of them started off with these criteria
being met.</p>
<p>So what’s the big deal, you ask?  All these projects delivered in the
end, didn’t they?  Yes.  They did.</p>
<p>However, organizations in the software development industry have an
average reported productivity rate of between 10 – 15%. Yes, it is not a
typo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On average 10 – 15% of all <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/02/12/one-to-one/">time
spent is directly contributing to the successful</a> delivery of a
product or service. Or, to put it in terms of non-value added time, that
means about 80- 90% time wasted on non-value add work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine what you could ship if you could increase your productivity
at <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/09/16/chrome-extensions-for-more-productive-remote-work/">work
to just 30%</a>?</p>
<p>The irony is that this is probably one of the easiest and cheapest <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/08/19/overlooked-factors-affecting-productivity/">productivity
at work</a> fixes to implement, yet most people don’t see the value of
this.  So let me try to explain why it makes such a difference.</p>
<h2 id="connection-and-flow">Connection and Flow</h2>
<p>Connection.  It all boils down to a sense of connection to the end
result.</p>
<p>In large projects, typically, the team works on only a small,
fragmented part of the system. They rarely meet a real user or complete
end-to-end workflow. Often they don’t even interact with all the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/09/24/names-of-team-members/">team
members</a> contributing to the same project.  This leads people to
disconnect from the result.   When <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/02/28/the-impact-of-fear-on-productivity/">they
are disconnected,</a> they don’t fully comprehend the consequences of
their actions on other <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2015/11/16/open-cultural-systems-in-business/">parts
of the system</a> and they possibly don’t care that much either.  As
long as what is in their control works.  As long as they get paid at the
end of the month.</p>
<p>In lean terms, <strong>flow</strong> is your ultimate goal.  When the
production line flows smoothly, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/12/04/employees-working-remotely/">productivity
at work</a> soars.  That means each part smoothly flows through the
system from inception or idea to final delivery of a sold product.  When
there is a problem in the process, the flow is interrupted until the
issue is resolved.  It doesn’t matter whose fault it is or in whose
department or team the issue is.  It means a hold-up in the process and
that translates to the flow being interrupted.   Interrupted flow =
lower productivity.</p>
<p>In software development or the service industry, there is no
difference.  It’s just that the work is mostly not <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2017/03/14/leadership-vision/">visualized
adequately</a> and waste has become acceptable as a norm.  But just
because everyone does it, doesn’t mean it’s right.</p>
<h2 id="the-antidote">The antidote</h2>
<p>Making a project or task feel more achievable, requires the team to
have a clear connection to the end-results as well as how they fit into
the bigger picture and where they are in relation to these goals.  It’s
exactly like the moving marker on your GPS constantly showing you where
you are to help you get to your destination.  It zooms in on what’s
relevant now (the Kanban or Scrum board) while keeping a visual
reference to the end destination (product vision or goal).</p>
<figure>
<img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/portfolio-peppar-product-roadmap-300x169.png"
alt="sample product roadmap" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">sample product roadmap</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By visualizing a roadmap with well-defined milestones and project
vision statement, such as the example to the right, a project suddenly
feels more achievable.  The goal is to connect the dots that will lead
you to your vision, understanding that the road is a curvy one paved
with all sorts of obstacles along the way.  The roadmap is vague and
possibly abstract with a high-level goal which merely guides your
decisions. It shows the stepping stones to break down an unachievable
big goal into something that can be done right now.</p>
<p>In this example, the first phase of the project was geared towards
building a network that will allow for enough traction to build the
actual product vision for a startup, which was an internet of things
application.   The first phase is necessary to get to the third phase
but does not necessarily feel as if it is productive as you’re building
something other (virtual business cards) than what the vision actually
is.  However, without first getting the information and network to
collaborate with, the end result of a collaboration app is
impossible.</p>
<p>While the team is working on one of the smaller milestones that might
feel irrelevant to the end goal, they can easily reference how this
relates to the end-goal.  These goals serve as a judge to determine
whether what you propose to do is actually productive or not each time
you have to make a decision.  It helps keep the team on track by
preventing them by getting distracted doing what might be viewed as
productive but turns out not to be.  How many times have you gotten so
involved in the details of a project and what each granular piece should
do that you lost track of the ultimate goal?</p>
<p>A visual roadmap makes a big project feel more achievable. It serves
as a guide.  It helps you to take the next step up the mountain when you
can’t see the peak, knowing that each step is in the right direction,
and thus a productive step.</p>

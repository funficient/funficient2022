    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<blockquote>
<p>Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work,
rather than being directed by others outside the team. — The Scrum
Guide</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Utopia.</em> We get to decide how to do our work! No irritating
team lead looking over our shoulders telling us what to do.</p>
<p><em>What could possibly go wrong?</em></p>
<p>Actually, a lot more than you think. Most teams love the idea of
being self-organizing, until they have to take accountability for the
problems that pop up as a result. No longer can they blame the bad
planning, the tools, or the process for not delivering that others
imposed on them. Now, they were the ones who did the planning, chose the
tools and implemented the process.</p>
<h2 id="transformers">Transformers</h2>
<p>In Sci-Fi transformations happen magically.</p>
<p>Fast. Instantly.</p>
<p>In the real world, however, we need a little more time and practice.
<em>Even though we’re on our way to becoming superheroes, but we’re not
quite there yet. Expecting to be self-organizing after a lifetime of
being managed by others in just one sprint or a few is a little harsh.
Like any sustainable change, it’s a journey, not a magical click of the
fingers.</em></p>
<p>The easiest journeys are ones that are predictable, well-planned, and
well within your comfort zones. When you climb mount Everest for the
first time though, it’s an adventure filled with unpredictable events
and circumstances. Even for the most experienced climbers it remains a
risky encounter.</p>
<p>Moving towards self-organizing teams is more like an adventure than
an easy drive through the back-roads of Europe with your Eyewitness
travel guide on your lap.</p>
<h2 id="planning-the-adventure">Planning the Adventure</h2>
<p>An adventure requires different planning than an enjoyable road trip
through the countryside. For an adventure you plan how you’ll handle the
<em>unknown</em>. You focus on the <em>difficulties</em> ahead and how
you’ll overcome them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You value responding to change over following a plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that you don’t have to plan. Actually, you need
to be better prepared and plan more than what you would have for an easy
country drive.</p>
<p>And you need rules.</p>
<h2 id="rules-no-way">Rules? No way!</h2>
<p><em>Rules make us feel safe.</em> Imagine driving in India, compared
to Germany — two extreme examples when it comes to road rules.</p>
<p>In Germany, the roads are in good condition, <em>designed</em> for a
smooth ride. There you sit back, switch on some music and converse with
the person with you in the car, while enjoying the beautiful countryside
around you. You’re relaxed and can focus on the landscapes around you,
rather than to focus all your attention on how to avoid an accident.</p>
<p>You don’t have to know why the authorities came up with the rules,
and you don’t have to understand the science behind it. You don’t have
to worry about the complexity and logistics that go into designing the
roads. All you need to do is follow the rules.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you’re managed by an experienced team lead, someone
else worries about the complexities and obstacles on your journey. All
you have to do, is make sure that you bring your part and enjoy the
ride.</p>
<p>Self-organizing teams, however, take responsibility for these
obstacles themselves and the journey can rather be compared to driving
in India, where it’s a constant adventure compared to Germany. The
driver has to constantly be on high alert, responding to the elements
around him, rather than follow the rules.</p>
<p>There are rules, but you can’t exactly tell the elephants and cows
that roam the streets to adhere to them. You have to bend and be
flexible if you want to avoid an accident.</p>
<p>Becoming a self-organizing team is unexplored territory for most
organizations, without defined rules and best practices. We have to make
up these rules based on what works, and what doesn’t. We have to also
bend and be flexible and react to our environment.</p>
<p>We don’t know all the answers yet, but we do know enough to make the
journey a little less bumpy. We know that <em>values are more important
than technical skills</em>, and we know that it takes a lot of
responsibility.</p>
<p>We also need the following to be self-organizing, or autonomous:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trust and respect.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Trust is the foundation of any functional team, and respect is
the glue that ensures that it doesn’t fall apart.</em> Without a strong
foundation, your house of cards are likely to crumble down with the
first instability that presents itself.</p>
<p><strong>2. Good communication skills.</strong></p>
<p>Communication is the art of being understood, and trying to
understand a viewpoint other than your own. It’s a <em>we</em>-mentality
rather than a me-against-you one. It’s about finding the <em>AND</em> as
apposed to focusing on the <em>OR</em>.</p>
<p><em>What do we have in common? How can we help each other achieve our
goals? What do I know that will make your life easier? And what do you
think?</em></p>
<p>These questions build strong teams. Sitting together and sharing
resources don’t make you a team (read more about the <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-is-agile-anyway-part-2-6a0934681ca6#.gsa3sznfu">one-person-team
in part 2</a>). <strong><em>A team shares a vision, not
resources.</em></strong> They work together to achieve more than what
one person can on his own, and that means you have to listen and
contribute to the conversations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Strong relationships, at home or work, are based on trust and
communication. But if there is no communication there will be no trust.
— Simon Sinek</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>3. Know each team member’s strengths and
weaknesses.</em></strong></p>
<p>Most jobs emphasize the hard skills needed to fit a specific role in
the organization. A business analyst, with experience in SQL. A java
developer with experience in eCommerce and mobile solutions. Good
attention to detail, can-do attitude. You get the picture….</p>
<p>The biggest criticism I have of these type of job descriptions is
that it’s so generic. A one-size-fits-all solution where each role is
created based on the generic skills, placing little emphasis on the
specific strengths and weaknesses of the <em>individual</em>, and how
the individual can contribute.</p>
<p>It’s simply multiplying what you already have, or had in the past.
You’re not creating an environment conducive to self-managing teams.
Self-organizing teams are more like searching for the right, uniquely
different puzzle piece that is missing from building a whole
picture.</p>
<p><img

href="http://www.unsplash.com">www.unsplash.com</a></p>
<p>They know each others technical skills as well as their personality
and communication style. They can form a whole from putting the
different parts together.</p>
<p>Self-organizing teams know the strengths and weaknesses of each team
member, and how to use it best.</p>
<p><strong>4. Solve a problem.</strong></p>
<p>Self-organizing teams work together towards a shared purpose. They
focus on a desired outcome, specific to an audience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Are you delivering value? Or are you producing
artifacts?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you focus on a specific problem to solve, or shared purpose, you
spend less time competing, and more time collaborating. And
collaboration is key.</p>
<p><strong>5. Clearly, aligned requirements.</strong></p>
<p>Expanding on the previous point, for a team to be autonomous, knowing
the problem to solve is as important as knowing exactly what is expected
from them <em>now</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the best action right now that I can take to bring me closer
to the desired solution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can’t be ambiguity and disagreement as to what each person
thinks should be done. It should be clear, and it should be aligned
throughout the team.</p>
<p><strong>6. High confidence levels.</strong></p>
<p>When a team knows <em>what</em> they need to do, and they know
<em>who</em> is best at to get it done, they are able to quickly
organize the tasks and get to work. That doesn’t however automatically
mean that they <em>can</em> do it.</p>
<p>When you aren’t confident in your ability to complete a task, you
aren’t able to work autonomously. Whether it is because you’re new to
the team, or using new tools, autonomy requires high confidence, even if
it is as simple as having high confidence that you will be able to learn
what is required from you.</p>
<p>You need to believe in yourself. You need to trust yourself and your
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>7. Humility.</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t believe in yourself, you can of course ask for help or
guidance. That requires humility in many cases. An autonomous team
leaves their ego at the door, and is always open to alternative
solutions to problems.</p>
<p>When you believe you know all the answers, or that you should
<em>look</em> as if you know all the answers, you put the entire team at
risk of not delivering.</p>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes and no-one knows it all. A functional team
admits when they’re wrong, they apologize, and they ask for help. They
also ask where they can help when they see other team members struggle,
even if it means that they have to do something considered beneath their
seniority.</p>
<p><strong>8. Defined authority and decision making.</strong></p>
<p>When things go well autonomy and self-organization within a team is
not a problem. It is when things <em>don’t</em> go well that things
start falling apart.</p>
<p>For autonomy to work, there needs to be clear guidelines on
authority-levels and who can make decisions that impact the whole team
or other teams.</p>
<p>When things go well, everyone is empowered to make decisions and
enforce it. When a problem is hit that falls outside of your comfort
zone, the proposed decision is first discussed with the nominated go-to
person.</p>
<p><em>There isn’t one person who carries all the authority, rather,
there are different go-to people for different type of issues.</em> A
technical issue might be discussed with someone other than a personality
clash.</p>
<p>Rather than defining a policy or procedure, define a decision making
<em>process</em>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Self-organizing teams need great technical skills, but even more than
that, they need strong shared values. They need trust, respect, and
great communication. They also need to be humble, leaving their ego at
the door, always focusing on what is best for the team and the
customers, rather than what’s best for me.</p>

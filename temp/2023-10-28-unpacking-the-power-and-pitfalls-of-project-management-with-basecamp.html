    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<blockquote>
<p><em>What is the essence of good project management?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is what makes <a
href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> a good choice when you’re
looking for a tool to manage your projects. This post takes a deep dive
into Basecamp after using the tool to manage projects, and being part of
the Basecamp Community where insider tips and insights into how the
Basecampers use their tool is shared.</p>
<h3 id="a-short-history-of-everything">A short history of
everything…</h3>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Basecamp, it’s a simple project
management tool built and used by the team of 37 Signals primarily as a
tool to scratch their own itch. This is a rare example of dogfooding to
the extreme. After more than two decades, they’re still eating their own
dog food, while accumulating thousands of paid users as well as a rather
cult-like following.</p>
<p>I was curious to find out what exactly makes them so popular, having
used the tool myself and not being <em>that</em> impressed with what it
could do. Sure, it is much simpler and cleaner than most other project
management tools. And there’s the fancy Hill Charts and Fire Side Chats.
But I also found I spent more time administering projects than what
should be needed, and couldn’t tell the status of any project at a
glance. So I decided to go under the hood and find out whether it was
our team who was doing it wrong, or if there’s maybe some other reason
why it’s so popular. <strong><em>Get the full <a
href="https://www.funficient.com/product-teardowns">product teardown</a>
here.</em></strong></p>
<p>The short answer is both. Our team was being micro-managed and had
very limited access to customize the tool to be more efficient. I also
found that the cult-like following wasn’t necessarily about the quality
or content of the tool, but rather admiration for a team who created a
great piece of technology — namely Ruby on Rails. The die-hard fans all
seemed to have one thing in common — they were programmers who admired
the technical excellence of the founders of Basecamp — the first tool
ever built on Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>On the upside, however, I also discovered that Basecamp managed to
create a tool that satisfied the primary need that distinguishes average
project management from great project management, regardless of the
tool. <strong><em>Communication.</em></strong></p>
<p>They figured out what most other tools to this day haven’t yet.</p>
<p>But let me not get ahead of myself. Let’s start at the start. Who
would best benefit from the tool?</p>
<h3 id="who-is-it-for-and-who-is-it-not-for">Who is it for? And who is
it not for?</h3>
<p>The ideal users are independent freelancers, or small teams. Bonus
points for remote first, asynchronous software delivery teams. It’s used
by small teams such as design and development agencies, non-profits,
educational institutions, architects, interior designers, and anyone
looking for a <em>simple</em> project management tool to manage a few
rather small projects. </p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/blog/basecamp-target-user.png"
alt="The target user wants simplicity and flexibility." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The target user wants simplicity and
flexibility.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tool shines in comparison to other project management tools in
terms of its simplicity. You don’t have to figure out where to find
information and everything is explained in simple, easy-to-understand
English. There are also limited options so you’re never overwhelmed with
choices.</p>
<p>While it has been adopted by some larger organizations, there’s
definitely some scaling issues making it best suited for smaller teams.
Ultimately, though, regardless of your size, it’s for teams looking for
a tool to manage projects without the disciplines typically associated
with project management.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-basecamp-great">What makes Basecamp great?</h3>
<p>Basecamp, according to me, has two value propositions that stands out
above other project management tools. </p>
<p>Firstly, it is centered around <em>communication</em>, with in-built
chat a core feature, as well as the ability to share pages for easier
collaboration. </p>
<p>Secondly, it brings together everything into a single place. You
don’t need a tool to chat, a tool to manage projects, and another tool
to store information. Basecamp offers a seamlessly integrated solution
that allows everyone involved in a project to chat, work, and track
progress. While most project management tools are for project managers
only, Basecamp is a tool that includes <em>everyone</em> — even the
customers.</p>
<h3 id="product-values">Product Values</h3>
<p>Most companies have values they live by, and so do good products. You
can clearly tell a products values by interacting with it for a while.
The primary values I identified for Basecamp as product are simplicity,
innovation, and trust.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity">1. Simplicity</h3>
<p>First and foremost, and most important to the team of 37 Signals as
well as the tool, is simplicity. This is also the reason why Ruby on
Rails became so popular. Both do as little as possible to get things
done. This is not only a value but a core strength of the product.</p>
<p>Whenever they design a new feature they ask themselves what the
simplest thing they can do to solve the specific problem, or get the job
done.</p>
<h3 id="innovation">2. Innovation</h3>
<p>A close second value is innovation. The 37 Signals team don’t like to
flow downstream with the masses. They love doing everything in their
unique way. If other people call it an Inbox, they can’t resist making
it their own and calling it an Imbox (yes, that’s intentional, it’s not
a typo). If other people use a timeline to measure progress, they add a
curve and call it a hill chart.</p>
<p>They don’t do anything conventional, which leads to fresh
perspectives to old problems. It also means they spend more time than
the average company trying to understand the problem they’re trying to
solve before jumping towards a solution.</p>
<p>They’re definitely not a follower and would probably rather die than
admit an outsider’s idea was good enough to copy or use.</p>
<h3 id="trust">3. Trust</h3>
<p>The third and final value which is also core to the success of the
product as well as the team behind it, is trust. They are ethical to the
bones and do what’s right as far as possible. They take care to keep
your data safe and they prioritize great customer support.</p>
<h3 id="okrs">OKRs</h3>
<p>From an outside perspective with no insight into what is planned for
the future, except some signals indicating geographic expansion, the key
objective for the organization as a whole is to <strong><em>enable
better communication</em></strong> on projects. This entails both
communication in the form of chat and longer form communication, as well
as finding, referring to, and using shared assets.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/blog/basecamp-core-value.png"
alt="Key business objectives" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Key business objectives</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The secondary objectives to meet this primary objective are:</p>
<h3 id="objective-1-increase-word-of-mouth-referrals">Objective 1:
Increase word-of-mouth referrals</h3>
<p>As their primary growth is as a result of word-of-mouth referrals,
they aim to create a product so good that people talk about it. This
sometimes means unique features like hill charts, and at other times
more controversial features like the hidden “fff*** you” when blocking
emails.</p>
<p>This also means content creation is a core part of their strategy.
They have published numerous books, blog regularly, have a podcast, and
share behind-the-scenes video’s that is sharable on social media.</p>
<h3 id="objective-2-stand-out-as-innovator">Objective 2: Stand out as
innovator</h3>
<p>The 37 signal crowd is rebels at their core. They want to be
different than the rest and another key strategy for them is to be a
leader. Innovation is ingrained in their DNA and they approach
everything they do from a problem perspective.</p>
<p>While most companies do competitor analysis and then add the most
popular items to their backlog in a follow-the-leader approach, 37
Signals actively find alternative ways to solve the same problem. This
leads to fresh ideas which increases the word-of-mouth referrals and is
a core business objective.</p>
<h3 id="objective-3-grow-the-community">Objective 3: Grow the
community</h3>
<p>Basecamp has never been in the top list of project management tools
for obvious reasons, but that is starting to change. They’re starting to
gain more visibility and has recently opened up their community
headquarters to invite fans and users to connect and share ideas in a
Basecamp project.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to the community for Basecamp, largely
getting direct feedback from users and having access to willing (and
free) beta testers to improve their offering. Also, it increases the
likelihood of increasing loyalty and word-of-mouth referrals.</p>
<p>With these objectives in mind, it would be impossible to measure
progress without some key results to keep an eye on. After all, you
can’t improve what you don’t know.</p>
<h3 id="key-result-1-increase-revenue">Key result 1:
Increase revenue</h3>
<p>No business is sustainable if it isn’t profitable, thus, growing
revenue remains important for any business. As community and great
support is so important to Basecamp, the one metric I would choose to
keep an eye on when it comes to profitability is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Customer lifetime value to acquisition cost ratio</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="key-result-2-increase-satisfaction">Key result 2: Increase
satisfaction</h3>
<p>Word-of-mouth being their primary growth channel, measuring
satisfaction is even more important than most companies. The two metrics
I would recommend are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Net promoter score</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For obvious reasons, if people stop being satisfied with the product
they won’t recommend it to a friend, thus this is a key metric to
include. Even more important, however, is monitoring the feature
adoption and usage rates. If I had to choose only one, I would choose
this one to measure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Feature adoption and usage rates</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While people might say they will tell a friend about the product, a
more accurate signal of satisfaction is the usage rate of different
features. If users don’t regularly use the features that make them stand
out as an innovator, they risk losing their key differentiator that will
keep people loyal.</p>
<h3 id="key-result-3-increase-usage">Key result 3: Increase usage</h3>
<p>To expand on the usage rates, the two key metrics I would measure to
know whether usage is increasing, include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Daily and monthly active users</em></p>
<p><em>Monthly active community members</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first would be interesting to track how many new sign-ups remain
active after a month, 90 days, and year increments there after. </p>
<p>Secondly, as the community is essentially the brand ambassadors and
sales force, their level of enthusiasm and activity could also provide
valuable signals regarding the growth of the community.</p>
<h3 id="core-systems-loop">Core systems loop</h3>
<p>Project management touches on all parts of an organization, making it
the heart of the organization. It is primarily driven by a single
reinforcing loop. The more accurate information available, the better
decisions and estimations you can make, leading to a higher probability
of delivering projects successfully. In turn, the more you prove to be
successful at delivering a project, the higher the chance the people
will refer or re-use your services.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/blog/basecamp-core-systems-diagram-2.png"
alt="Core systems loop" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Core systems loop</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thus, the core systems loop driving the engine behind Basecamp
relates to the ability to gather, organize, and respond to information
in a reinforcing loop. This, typically, is in the form of keeping track
of to-do’s and keeping discussions around a project in one place.</p>
<h3 id="a-deeper-dive">A deeper dive</h3>
<p>Taking a step closer to the nuts and bolts, but still on a high
level, there are four main phases of using a product as defined by the
<a href="https://gamethinking.io/">Game Thinking framework</a> which I
will now use to evaluate the product. </p>
<p>First, there’s the discovery, phase then onboarding (or getting
started), followed by the primary habit loop and core engine of the
product. Finally, there is the mastery phase for select loyal followers
and super users of a system. Below is a short summary of the strengths
and weaknesses of each phase.</p>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
<p>By far Basecamp’s biggest strength is the discovery phase. Their
landing page is solid and they have a large and loyal following. They
are adored by programmers across the globe who are avid advocates for
their products and methods.</p>
<h4 id="what-works">What works?</h4>
<p>The landing page is filled with visuals, customer testimonials, and
open resources like books and blogs. This gives people a reason to trust
the product and the company, as well as provide plenty of opportunity to
share content to further expand their reach.</p>
<p>The clear and simple pricing reduces the risk of switching — arguably
the biggest barrier to entry. The pricing seems fair and affordable for
most companies, especially when comparing it to competitor products like
Clickup and Asana. There’s also a simple model of paying per team member
with guests (clients and external contributors) being free, further
reducing the risk and increasing the organic growth.</p>
<p>Finally, there is abundant evidence that they are strong on support,
even with the CEO’s email address widely published and inviting users to
get in touch. Even though in practice I have no idea what happens with
these mails as it doesn’t result in any response, it still contributes
to the perception of trust.</p>
<h4 id="what-could-be-better">What could be better?</h4>
<p>Having been part of the community for a while, there seems to be
pricing options not available on the pricing page. This can be rather
confusing at times, especially when they refer to products like Hey as
something separate but there’s no reference to it on the pricing
page.</p>
<p>It is evident that the product, which has been around for over two
decades, has grown and the documentation hasn’t always kept up to date
with the changes, making it hard for a new comer to know what the older
following assumes as common knowledge.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s slightly annoying is that the sales pitch is
rather, mmmm…. too much. It feels somewhat arrogant and pushy.</p>
<h3 id="get-started-onboarding">Get started (onboarding)</h3>
<p>The onboarding process is pretty straightforward, with a few design
decisions I would question, but on average, simple enough (provided
you’re not inviting contributors yet).</p>
<h4 id="what-works-1">What works?</h4>
<p>The one-page setup (excluding inviting contributors) are easy to
follow and allows you to get started within minutes. Compare this to
other tools which often requires extensive setups, this is a huge
benefit.</p>
<p>Once you complete sign-up, you land on a clean page with limited
options, reducing cognitive overload. There’s a quick start guide as
well as a sample project to see how the Basecampers use the product.</p>
<p>Finally, the ability to integrate other products via “doors” allows
you to create a portal that keeps all the assets, resources, and
information easily accessible in one place. </p>
<h4 id="what-could-be-better-1">What could be better?</h4>
<p>Inviting contributors to a project is overly complicated and rather
confusing. The process isn’t streamlined and the design decisions are
somewhat, mmm… interesting?</p>
<p>It’s evident that it’s an old product that has grown over the years,
with clearly different designers working on different parts of the
product as there’s little consistency when using design assets. This
somewhat negatively impacts the learnability of the product.</p>
<p>It’s also not clear for a new user what the intent or function of
different blocks are. For example, there seems to be no difference
between a <em>Message Board</em> page and a <em>Docs &amp; Files</em>
page making it unclear when to use which. The Schedule is also what I
would rather call a Calendar, and the Card Table seems to be an add-on
that isn’t integrated to the rest of the product. I would assume that a
card and a to-do, for example, can be cross referenced, but it requires
duplicate work to update the two features separately, making it rather
inefficient. Plus, there’s an extra step to force a triage (I
<em>really</em> wish we would stop using this term for software! We’re
not dealing with people requiring urgent medical assistance!) of all new
cards which is counter intuitive and inefficient.</p>
<h3 id="get-better-core-learning-loop">Get better (core
learning loop)</h3>
<p>This is a strong part of the tool, as it is the only, or at least one
of a handful, project management tool that includes customer chat and
access to shared documents in one place.</p>
<h4 id="what-works-2">What works?</h4>
<p>As mentioned, being able to share documents and pages directly with
customers and keeping all the conversations in one place is by far the
biggest benefit of using this tool over competitors.</p>
<p>Another area where it shines is the activity summary and the daily
email digest. Here you can quickly glance over or catch up on activities
you’ve missed, which is much more preferable than navigating the
notifications (see below for more on this.)</p>
<p>The ability to setup a project template is quick and easy, making it
exceptionally easy to create a re-usable, standardized project in
minutes.</p>
<p>Another feature which was recently launched that is long overdue and
much needed is the ability to stack projects into a pile on your
desktop. The only downside is that it will remain undiscovered by anyone
who isn’t a die-hard Basecamp follower as there is no way to discover
this feature via the interface. This, according to them, was
intentional. Weird…</p>
<h4 id="what-could-be-better-2">What could be better?</h4>
<p>By far the biggest issue is how notifications work. Most new users
are overwhelmed with notifications and complain about the sheer volume.
It’s an either on or off switch to set notifications, choosing between
being overwhelmed by every time anything happens, from receiving a
message, to someone commenting on a page or project, to check-ins, the
list goes on, and receiving no notifications at all.</p>
<p>To make this problem worse, there are multiple settings on different
levels for setting notifications, overriding settings you might think
you’ve already set with again no indication in the interface to make it
clear what you’ve set. It also seems as if the switches are buggy as
even when I switch it on or off it doesn’t work as expected.</p>
<p>Although I’m not a big fan of notifications and usually the first
thing I witch off when using new software, it can be handy to be
notified of certain things when managing a time critical project. There
is huge room for improvement in this area of the product and probably
one of the things that would have the biggest impact on new customer
satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>Already touched on, another area that is rather annoying is that none
of the elements seem integrated, resulting in a lot of duplicate work.
For example, checking off to-do’s doesn’t result in the hill charts
being updated (even though it gets created from to-do’s). Or moving
cards on the card table doesn’t change the status of to-do’s. </p>
<p>Another big disadvantage is that everything is on separate pages.
There is no one single page where one can see the health of the project
or status at a glance. In order to know what’s going on with a project,
you have to navigate to a number of different pages to see the status.
This would be one of the biggest improvement areas when considering
larger organizations as target audience in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="mastery">Mastery</h3>
<p>The mastery phase is adequate and allows for super users to customize
the project. Opening up the community also greatly improved the
motivation for users to stay loyal to the product and tell others about
it.</p>
<h4 id="what-works-3">What works?</h4>
<p>There are nearly unlimited options to modify the inner workings of
the product with webhooks and create custom workflows, notifications,
and reports — provided you have access to an in-house developer who can
manage it.</p>
<p>The community is also a wonderful resource to get tips and insights
on how to solve product (and other) problems as well as connect with
other Basecampers. Best of all community members are able to add their
wishes and complaints about the product. This doesn’t mean that it will
get resolved, but it does influence the roadmap to a certain degree.</p>
<h4 id="what-could-be-better-3">What could be better?</h4>
<p>It’s a founder-lead product with the community wishes not necessarily
leading the product direction. It’s as if the doors to the house have
been opened, but people haven’t been invited to come inside. </p>
<p>This is probably due to their approach to building software, which
intentionally excludes a backlog or roadmap. Each cycle (lasting 6
weeks) they decide what they want to build. However, from a growth
strategy perspective, if people believed they were co-creating the
product rather than just an outside observer or cheerleader, their
loyalty would most probably increase drastically as co-creative tools
like Figma, Miro etc have proven over and over again.</p>
<p>There is also no benefit to users to refer the product, like an
affiliate program or discounts for referrals. This is not something that
necessarily <em>should</em> be added to the product strategy, but it
would definitely benefit their growth if they did include a more
user-focused tactic.</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>
<p>Basecamp is an innovative project management tool that is changing
the way project management is done. They understand the essence of good
project management is good communication, and has built a product that
enables good communication for the whole team, making it stand out as a
leader.</p>
<p>It is, however, not the most intuitive user experience and lacks a
lot of functionality considered basic by users coming from other project
management tools. It’s best suited for small, informal teams that
doesn’t need formal project management, but simply a way to keep track
of what’s happening and have access to a portal to access
information.</p>

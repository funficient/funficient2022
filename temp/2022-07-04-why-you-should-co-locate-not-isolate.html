    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="finding-the-balance-between-remote-and-co-located-work">Finding
the balance between remote and co-located work</h2>
<p>I love technology, automation, and what robots can do for us. I’ve
never seen robots taking jobs over as a bad thing as these are usually
jobs people hate doing in the first place. Rather than see it as
competition, I see it as a collaboration that frees us up to do
something we would rather be doing, while the robots take care of those
boring, mundane and repetive tasks.</p>
<p>The one thing robots can’t however do as well as human beings is
relationships. And although it is possible to have digital relationships
that are strong and healthy, in-person relationships are always
better.</p>
<p><strong>Technology is an amplifier.</strong> If you’re a ‘healthy’
team with healthy team dynamics, remote work canbe brilliant and
empowering. <strong><em>It’s, however, an advanced tool for more mature
(responsible) teams</em></strong>. Transitioning into remote work
without the necessary preparation <strong><em>will amplify your problems
much faster than what it solves it.</em></strong></p>
<p>There are a number of obstacles working remotely that doesn’t exist
in face-to-face communication.</p>
<h2 id="remote-obstacle-1-visibility">Remote obstacle #1 —
visibility</h2>
<p>There was never really the honeymoon period I expected to feel when I
first started to work remotely. At first, I felt immense pressure to
show results and look busy online for that odd chance that my boss or
team will check in on me when I walk away from my screen for just a few
minutes — which always seemed to happen.</p>
<p><em>What can I say. Murphy is a bitch…</em></p>
<p>I ended up working <em>more</em> than what I did when I was
co-located and spent way more time in front of the screen than
before.</p>
<p>In a co-located workplace I could easily be there and do nothing,
maybe chatting to a colleague over coffee, strengthening our
relationships. Sometimes productively, sometimes less productive, but
nevertheless, it was my physical presence that put my managers and teams
at ease. Simply being visible made everyone feel safe.</p>
<p>Yet, remotely I was expected to not only <em>be</em> there, but be
behind my computer screen and busy typing for all the hours I was
expected to work. If you use automated time logging tools you’ll be
familiar with this problem and understand that being productive or busy
does not necessarily mean that you are typing on your computer.</p>
<p>The moment I was spending time scribbling on a notepad or thinking
(about work), but not actively busy, I would receive a ping from my boss
just to check in. It sucked.</p>
<p><em>I felt exhausted at the end of the day and I was less productive
than normal, having no space to think or restore.</em></p>
<h2 id="remote-obstacle-2-lack-of-focus">Remote obstacle #2 — lack of
focus</h2>
<p>Being aware of this problem I was curious whether it’s a me-only
issue or more general. I started observing other people’s behaviors. I
noticed how much time was wasted chatting to look busy, but not being
productive.</p>
<p>Where in a co-located office I can switch off and focus for a while,
in a remote setting it’s much harder with the constant interruptions
that causes you to have to multitask and switch between chat and
work.</p>
<p>For anyone who’s not familiar with the cost of task-switching, it’s
probably the biggest enemy of productivity. Each time you switch it
takes on average 15–20 minutes to re-focus on your productive work. In a
remote setting, you need to be more responsive to be visible, which
means more switching.</p>
<p>The success of remote work depends largely on the level of
responsibility and honesty of the team and when a team is new to remote
work, most probably they are going to make the most of their newly found
freedom from control and do much less.</p>
<p>I’ve experienced responsible team members, but I’ve also had to deal
with people working double jobs, hoping you won’t notice (but I always
do because my superpower is seeing the invisible), or simply not pulling
their weight hoping they can talk their way around it by using vague and
confusing language like ‘busy’, ‘stuff’, etc.</p>
<h2 id="remote-obstacle-3-loneliness">Remote obstacle #3 —
loneliness</h2>
<p>Once I solved these problems, I became aware of the intense
loneliness I felt. Doing deep retrospect, and talking to a lot of
people, I realized that the number one reason — even higher than getting
paid — for people to join a workplace is to satisfy the need for social
connection. I heard so many stories of how people stuck out horrible
jobs and bosses just because they like their peers. <strong>People work
for the money, but they stay for the relationships.</strong> When
there’s no more space to cultivate the relationships, you risk losing
good employees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The number one reason — even higher than getting paid - for people
to join a company is for the social connection.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I missed the water cooler conversations and even the meetings that I
had in a co-located work environment.</p>
<h2 id="remote-obstacle-4-getting-answers">Remote obstacle #4 — getting
answers</h2>
<p>Loneliness under control and mechanisms in place to connect in person
with people, the third, and <em>very</em> frustrating, obstacle that
arose was getting answers.</p>
<p>In a co-located environment when I had a question I would write it in
my notebook and when I saw the person I needed to speak to was
available, I would walk up to them and ask my question. <em>And got
answers.</em></p>
<p>If we didn’t get answers, we would either call in another set of
skills for a different perspective; or brainstorm it in front of a white
board until we did. Getting answers was only ever an issue when it
involved decision making from the top.</p>
<p>Getting answers when working remotely is by far more challenging.
It’s just too easy to ignore a question when it’s not convenient or
comfortable to answer. In co-located offices healthy conflict is
welcomed, in a dysfunctional remote setting, it’s avoided at all cost.
<strong>No conflict, no growth.</strong></p>
<p>And no alignment.</p>
<h2 id="remote-obstacle-5-alignment">Remote obstacle #5 — alignment</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest issue of all with remote work is the difficulty
in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/01/20/the-a-b-cs-of-team-alignment/">aligning
people</a> remotely. Remotely it takes exponentially more time and
effort to align a team than in a co-located environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single biggest tool for team alignment is small and regular
conversations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a co-located environment this happens organically, re-enforced and
optimized by tools such as a daily stand-up.</p>
<p>In a more mature or agile workplace, there’s little to no need for
daily stand-ups as the team’s practiced daily communication enough in
order for it to happen organically, not scheduled or planned by a team
lead or Scrum Master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know you’ve got a healthy team dynamic going when the team
<strong>actually wants</strong> to speak to each other and share their
progress in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a remote setting, having group conversations is extremely
challenging as even the best tech makes it hard for more than two people
to have a flowing conversation. That means you have to have one-on-one
conversations with everyone in the team, <em>as well as</em> a team
session to synthesize. Remote conversations are better than nothing, but
<em>far</em> worse than in-person conversations.</p>
<p>With an entire team working remotely, the team lead or manager will
spend most of their time checking in with people, leaving no to little
time to focus on strategy, planning and other tasks for future focused
growth.</p>
<p><strong><em>So what to do?</em></strong></p>
<p>How do you limit your risk of infection (if you believe you might get
infected that is) <strong><em>and</em></strong> be productive at the
same time?</p>
<h1 id="small-is-beautiful">Small is beautiful</h1>
<p>As with all things, there’s a positive side to all the disadvantages
and obstacles as a result of the pandemic of 2020 that forced us all to
work remotely.</p>
<h2 id="small-teams">Small teams</h2>
<p>Small, cross functional teams are one of the foundational and most
basic practices of an agile team. Read more about <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-is-agile-anyway-part-2-6a0934681ca6?source=post_stats_page---------------------------">Why
Teams Should be Small</a> and <a
href="https://medium.com/p/2d2dd47a7c75?source=post_stats_page---------------------------">Why
Teams Should be Cross-Functional</a>.</p>
<p>Co-locate, but in smaller teams. Break down the large group into 3–8
people (ideally not more than 5), ensuring that you have all the skills
in the team to do the work. Rather than having one zoom call with the
whole company, have a few, more selective, calls with focused groups and
teams. Use a Scrum-of-Scrum approach or the 1-2-4-All liberating
structure format.</p>
<h2 id="balance-co-locate-and-remote">Balance Co-locate and Remote</h2>
<p>Pendulums go to the extreme right, then extreme left, and finally
find balance somewhere in the middle. The same is true with co-locate
and remote work.</p>
<p>Don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Remote work isn’t
<em>all</em> bad. It doesn’t have to be the one OR the other. What if
you can include both into a more hybrid approach?</p>
<p>Limit the number of hours or days co-locating rather than throwing it
out totally.</p>
<h2 id="be-very-clear-on-goals-and-objectives">Be very clear on goals
and objectives</h2>
<p>Remote work is only more productive when you know exactly what’s
expected from you. Explicitly communicate goals and objectives to the
team, in person, as well as in writing.</p>
<p>When you work remotely goals and objectives become even more
important than in-person. Make sure to communicate frequently and
check-in at least once a week to ensure everyone is on track.</p>
<h2 id="know-when-to-work-remotely-and-when-to-co-locate">Know when to
work remotely and when to co-locate</h2>
<p>There are certain types of work and certain phases in a project that
is more conducive and productive to work remotely than others. Usually,
at the start and end of a project you need to collaborate more.</p>
<p>When things are fuzzy you need to spend more time together than once
you know what to do and how your work impacts and relates to others’. At
the end of the project, you need to make sure all the loose ends are
tied together, and is not a time to work remotely.</p>
<p><strong><em>When, however, you are clear on your goals, the team is
established and roles clarified, it’s often more productive to work
remotely.</em></strong></p>
<p>The same applies to the type of work. For administrative, repetitive
work, it’s often more productive to work remotely. When, however, you
are exploring unknown territory — either in terms of the tools or
technology or the requirements — it’s better to co-locate. As a rule of
thumb, when there’s a lot of questions, get together. When there’s few
questions, go remote.</p>
<p>An ideal work week contains more co-located days than remote days,
with at least a daily check-in when remote.</p>
<h1 id="keep-calm-and-keep-co-locating">Keep calm and keep
co-locating</h1>
<p>There’s no one-size fits all when it comes to working in teams.
Deciding whether to work remotely, in-person, or maybe in a hybrid
setting is a complex decision involving a number of different elements.
If your team is responsible and the goals are clear, remote work can be
more productive. However, co-locating by far trumps when it comes to
relationships and communication which are the two most important aspects
for any successful and highly productive team.</p>

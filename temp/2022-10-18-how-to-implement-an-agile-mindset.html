    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">How to Implement an Agile Mindset</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

</header>
<p>The hardest part of undergoing an agile transformation is to
implement an agile mindset. Cultivating an agile mindset requires a
seasoned coach who will be able to demonstrate and teach the values of
the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>, as well as
the technical skills that form part of the underlying principles and
methods.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of companies select their agile coaches based on
certifications only, which is placing the emphasis on the technical
skills, neglecting the importance of the coaching skills and
mindset.</p>
<p>Beyond everything else, however, an agile coach is a coach. Sure,
they need to be a master of the agile methods they are trying to teach,
yet this alone does not make you a master at <em>teaching</em> agile —
it makes you a master at <em>doing</em> agile.</p>
<p>There’s a difference. A big one.</p>
<p>A master at agile methods alone can show people <em>how</em> to do
agile, while a master at <em>teaching</em> agile methods on the other
hand, is a transformational architect, instilling an agile mindset
throughout the organization. Someone who is able to inspire change,
someone who empowers the people to grow an agile mindset, someone who
teaches the teams how to learn how to be agile, rather than telling them
how to do it.</p>
<p>Both roles have value, and while you might need either the one or the
other, best results are always when there is a marriage of two
complementing, yet opposing forces. In the case of undergoing an agile
transformation, this is no different.</p>
<p>The difficulty lies more in knowing what to expect and what to look
for in an agile coach. Here are the top 10 things to look for when
choosing an agile coach:</p>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-starts-with-a-problem">1. An agile coach starts
with a problem</h2>
<p>As any seasoned consultant will tell you, the answer to any question
is always “it depends”. The same rings true to an agile
transformation.</p>
<p>Although it might have some value in implementing a standard Scrum
practice in your workplace, a really good coach, will rarely start with
a big bang approach, implementing an entire solution such as Scrum in
one go.</p>
<p>Rather, a really good coach will first observe and do a problem
analysis by speaking to the different stakeholders to get a holistic
view of the problem, not only management’s perspective of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything the agile coach suggests to implement, will be as a result
of solving a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means that they are a master of Scrum and other agile methods,
and know it well enough to be able to make a judgement call as to what
is needed to alleviate a specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-defines-success">2. An agile coach defines
success</h2>
<p>A really good agile coach will always embark on a leadership coaching
journey as part of their service offering, as they understand the
importance of defining success on an organizational level, as well as
ensuring alignment to the vision and values of the company.</p>
<p>All coaching sessions start with defining your goals. It is a way of
knowing when you’ve reach your goal. Without first taking the take to
concretely define some measurable goals, an agile transformation might
risk carrying on forever without making any measurable progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A seasoned agile coach will not only help you define what success
looks like, but make sure that you constantly reach defined milestones
and can see and quantify progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-takes-one-step-at-a-time">3. An agile coach takes
one step at a time</h2>
<p>Like the story of the tortoise and the hare, an agile coach can be
compared to the tortoise. They slowly, yet surely, progresses towards
the defined goals and make sure that everyone stays on track.</p>
<p>In the story, the hare got distracted, and too late realized that the
tortoise has overtaken him. Similarly, a good agile coach realizes that
the teams they work with risk being distracted as they speed up, and
will put measures in place to keep everyone focused on their goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They will implement one change at a time and ensure that it has
become ingrained in the habits and culture before incorporating the next
ingredient.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-perseveres">4. An agile coach perseveres</h2>
<p>The one thing you can be sure of when you embark on an agile
transformation is that there will be obstacles. A really good agile
coach will help you overcome these obstacles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good agile coach will ensure that the organization meets it’s
milestones, even when the going gets tough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to keep going when things go according to plan, but it’s
when things start falling apart that you can see the courage and
integrity of the leader and the coach.</p>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-helps-you-gain-a-different-perspective">5. An
agile coach helps you gain a different perspective</h2>
<p>A really good coach asks the right questions to help you see a
different perspective. They don’t tell you what to do, or how to do it.
Rather, they demonstrate a possibility, and then ask probing questions
that will help you come up with your own solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The really good agile coach allows you to experiment to find a
sustainable solution, and point out possible issues by asking questions.
They empower you to make your own decisions, and your own mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-supports-rather-than-suffocates">6. An agile
coach supports, rather than suffocates</h2>
<p>They don’t tell you what to do, but they also don’t leave you on your
own to struggle through the problem. They have found the perfect balance
between allowing you to grow, while ensuring that you have all the
support in place that you need in order to reach your goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A really good agile coach trusts the people they work with. They
remain objective and fair, yet caring and interested.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-keeps-the-big-picture-in-mind">7. An agile coach
keeps the big picture in mind</h2>
<p>While a Scrum Master is concerned with the details of the team they
work with, the agile coach has a helicopter view of the entire
organization. They see and point out the impact of changes on other
parts of the organization. They realize that you are as weak as your
weakest link, and you can only be as agile as your least agile team or
department.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Agile Coach ensures continuity and harmony throughout the
organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-values-people-more-than-process-and-tools">8. An
agile coach values people more than process and tools</h2>
<p>Though people, process and tools are equally important in an
organization, it is hard to keep these in balance, as there is a
constant dance between what is important at different times within the
organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The agile coach knows that process and tools support people, and
constantly question whether the processes and tools in the organization
does.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-is-compassionate-and-fair">9. An agile coach is
compassionate and fair</h2>
<p>An agile coach never follows rules blindly, or make judgements based
on a pre-defined set of rules. An agile coach judges each situation
after carefully evaluating it from different perspectives.</p>
<p>They realize that people are the most important part of any
organization, and that people, other than robots, have good and bad
days. They make the workplace a more human place to work, and makes
judgements that is fair.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They don’t treat everyone the same, because they realize that
everyone isn’t the same, and that, in itself, is the strength of the
organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-agile-coach-never-stops-learning">10. An agile coach never
stops learning</h2>
<p>Inherently, agility and a culture of learning in an organization, is
the same thing. You can’t keep improving or, as the manifesto puts it,
“uncovering better ways” to do things, if you don’t continue to
learn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agile coach can’t possibly teach or instill a culture of learning
without continuing to learn themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A really good agile coach continues to enroll in courses, workshops
and events where they can hear what other organizations or people are
doing. The best agile coaches and Scrum Masters I’ve seen, are the ones
that didn’t come from a software development background. They were able
to question things that others took for granted, and they were the ones
who brought a new perspective to the team.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Like any profession, you get bad people, average people, and a hand
full of really good people. The problem often comes that when you embark
on an agile transformation that you don’t know what really good looks
like.</p>
<p>This blog lists the top ten things to look for when evaluating the
skills and abilities of an agile coach. What do you think? What are the
most important thing you look for in an agile coach?</p>

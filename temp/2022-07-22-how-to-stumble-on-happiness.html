    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="how-to-lift-the-dark-cloud-of-depression">How to lift the dark
cloud of depression</h2>
<p><em>Recently, there’s a theme popping up from all the people I’m
interacting with. Feeling stuck. Restless. A frustrated feeling of not
being content with what you have, somehow yearning for something you
don’t know. A seemingly simple wish just to be happy.</em></p>
<p><em>Being happy. Sounds easy. Yet, the hardest thing ever.</em></p>
<p><em>This post takes an alternative and somewhat unconventional look
at how to find the light at the end of the tunnel, from personal
experience.</em></p>
<h2 id="is-this-it">Is this it?</h2>
<p>I once had a clinically depressed friend. Like in <em>seriously</em>
depressed. He had been diagnosed with all the different categories of
depression that you could possibly have. He was on anti-depressants and
had weekly appointments at the psychiatrists and psychologists and other
specialists to help him get through each day.</p>
<p>Before I met him, I didn’t really know anything about depression. I
knew it existed, but I didn’t know what it
<strong><em>is</em></strong>.</p>
<p>He taught me a lot about depression on a practical level. At first,
the feeling of being ashamed to admit his ‘disease’ to the world. Later,
the ticket to treat people badly. Finally, the source of his happiness.
The journey, however, a hard one. One that only the person suffering
from it can walk.</p>
<p>While he was fighting his childhood demons, one evening, shortly
after I broke up with my boyfriend, he told me he thinks I’m depressed
and referred me to his psychologist.</p>
<p><em>I</em> didn’t think I was depressed. I was just sad. A bit lost
maybe. And with a lot of hurt. But not <em>depressed</em>.</p>
<p>It all started one day, similar to any other day. I woke up one
morning, lying next to my boyfriend in my beautiful home and on my way
to a cool job earning a decent salary doing pretty much what I want
while thinking <em>“Is this it?”</em></p>
<p>Is this what happiness looks like? Is this the happiest I’ll get?</p>
<p>I didn’t think I was <em>unhappy</em>, I just wasn’t <em>happy</em>.
From the outside, it should have been enough — according to society that
is - but it wasn’t enough for <em>me</em>. I wanted more. So I broke up
with my boyfriend, quit my job and gave away all my earthly possessions
and went on my version of Eat, Pray, Love. Searching for more. Searching
for happiness.</p>
<p>The journey was a long and hard one, much harder than I thought it
would be, but I did find happiness, and this is what I’ve learned:</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know.">1. You don’t know what you
don’t know.</h2>
<p>I didn’t know I was unhappy. Even though I was diagnosed officially
as not depressed and totally sane by the country’s best psychologist, I
realised that if I’m totally honest with myself, I’ve been depressed
since I was a child. It’s just that in those days depression wasn’t a
thing yet and we didn’t have the internet to google it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t know what you don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing what I know now though, it’s easy to find what you’re looking
for when you know what to look for. It’s the hardest thing ever to
search for what you <em>don’t</em> know you’re looking for. It requires
a vulnerability, an openness, questioning the status quo
continuously.</p>
<p>Just because society tells us that the car, the job, the partner, the
<em>thing</em> will make you happy, doesn’t mean it’s true. Just because
your parents told you that what you have is enough and you should be
grateful for it, because <strong><em>that’s the way it is</em></strong>,
doesn’t mean it’s good enough for <em>you</em>. And that’s ok.</p>
<p><em>Just because society has conditioned us to believe that
suppressing our emotions and desires are virtuous, doesn’t mean it
is.</em></p>
<h2 id="you-dont-need-a-reason-to-validate-how-you-feel.">2. You don’t
need a reason to validate how you feel.</h2>
<p>There is nothing wrong with you when you’re unhappy. In actual fact,
when you start feeling depressed it’s a sign that something is going
<em>right</em>. It means you’re human. Sentient. Feeling.
<em>Alive</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only difference between a robot and a human being is the ability
to feel and express emotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people don’t want to admit they’re unhappy simply because from
the outside, it doesn’t look as if they have reason to be unhappy. They
are scared to look ungrateful. Selfish. Entitled. They’re scared of
being judged ‘bad’.</p>
<p>There are so many people with so little. There are people starving of
hunger in Africa, there is poverty in the slums of India, there is
people being killed in wars. Who are <em>you</em> to be unhappy with
your fancy car, beautiful home and ‘prize’ partner?</p>
<p>So what if I told you you weren’t <em>meant</em> to be happy all the
time? What if you could give yourself permission to feel bad?</p>
<p>Just like you wouldn’t know the joy of watching a beautiful sunrise
without the dark preceding it, just so you wouldn’t know true happiness
without the absence of it first.</p>
<p>So go ahead. Give yourself permission to feel bad.</p>
<h2 id="happiness-is-a-feeling.-not-a-thing.">3. Happiness is a feeling.
Not a thing.</h2>
<p>Society tells us that if only you get the bigger house, the more
important job, the nicer car, you’ll be happy. But here’s the thing. No
<em>stuff</em> in the world is going to <em>make</em> you happy. It’s an
inside job. It’s a feeling.</p>
<p>Having had a lot of money and having had no money at all, I can
attest to the fact that money doesn’t buy happiness. In actual fact, it
has <em>nothing</em> to do with happiness. It doesn’t make you happy and
it doesn’t make you unhappy either. So the good news is that you don’t
have to give it all away as I did. It’s not about that at all.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s the things you <em>didn’t</em> have that is making you
unhappy. It’s having your feelings invalidated. It’s being told to just
get over it because it’s not such a big deal, when it is for you. It’s
being told you’re exaggerating when they have no clue of the true
magnitude of the situation, just because they only see the tip of the
iceberg, unaware of what’s going on beneath the surface. It’s not having
had a parent hold you when you were sad or lonely. It’s not having
someone to talk to, to go to. It’s having been rejected or excluded when
you were miserable, only receiving love when you’re happy.
<em>Conditionally</em> being loved.</p>
<p>When you realise that it’s the feeling you want, not the thing, you
can skip the promotion, the big car or the fancy holidays and go
straight towards the feeling. You can feel free running next to the
ocean as much as you would driving a brand new sports car. You can feel
powerful pressing the button to make the traffic light go red for the
cars, making all the cars stop so you can cross the road, as you would
being CEO of a company. You can feel appreciated by helping someone
needy, just as you would being the brains behind a big project.</p>
<p><em>So if stuff doesn’t make you happy? What does?</em></p>
<h2 id="stop-managing-your-anger.">4. Stop managing your anger.</h2>
<p>The harder you try to manage your emotions, the louder it is going to
scream. The worst thing you can do to an emotion is suppress (or
depress) it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop looking for ways to manage your anger and other bad feeling
emotions and start finding ways to more functionally express it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nature of a lion is to hunt. The nature of a tree is to grow. The
nature of energy is to move. The nature of emotion is to feel.</p>
<p><em>E-<strong>motion</strong>-s.</em> Energy in motion.</p>
<p>When you try to manage your emotions, <em>that’s</em> when things
start to go bad. Rather than trying to stop yourself from feeling bad,
find a way to express it without impacting the people around you. Go for
a run. Or kick-boxing. Or make something. Or write it down.</p>
<p>Journalling is probably the best tool to express emotions and
understanding why you’re feeling the way you do. The process of writing
is healing in itself. It validates the things going on in your mind and
heart. And once a feeling is validated and accepted, it’s no longer
necessary and can move on. This is the process of finding happiness.</p>
<h2 id="make-friends-with-your-unhappiness.">5. Make friends with your
unhappiness.</h2>
<p>Most people view unhappiness as an unwelcome guest. They don’t
realise that the only difference between unhappiness and happiness is
the wrapping hiding the gift inside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To find the gift of happiness, you need to first remove the wrapping
of unhappiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means you have to sit with it for a while. Get to know it as you
would a friend.</p>
<p>Treat your unhappiness as you would a small child afraid of the
monsters in the dark. Hold it’s hand, switch on the light and show them
the proof that what they thought was a monster was just a shadow cast by
their favorite toy.</p>
<p>The same is true for the shadows within your soul. It hides the
treasures that brings you your greatest joy. When you are willing to sit
with the unhappiness and befriend it, it disappears naturally.</p>
<p>So next time you’re unhappy, refrain from distracting yourself or
ignoring it, rather go towards it like a friend. Be curious. Be kind.
Get to know it. Where is the feeling in your body? What is it trying to
tell you? What does it need from you?</p>
<p>Just sit with it. Hold your own hand while you’re feeling the
pain.</p>
<p><em>Remember. The light at the end of the tunnel might be
you.</em></p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>Investing in people is one of the most important things you can do as
a business owner. As part of the teal series, this post focuses on the
difference in approaching training between a predominantly ‘orange’ and
‘teal’ organization.  I’ll also address what teal training will look
like.</p>
<p>If you missed the previous parts of the teal series, here is a

</ul>
<p>In this post, I’ll first outline the typical ‘orange’ characteristics
of training within an organization. Then I’ll look at what a more ‘teal’
approach might look like. Finally, I’ll outline a rough roadmap to
transition from ‘orange’ to ‘teal’.</p>
<h2 id="why-invest-in-training">Why invest in training</h2>
<p>People, or human capital, are by far your most valuable resource as a
business owner. When you see people as assets rather than replaceable
parts, it makes sense to increase their value over time, as it will
increase your business value over time.</p>
<p>A key benefit of investing in training people is the probability that
it will increase people’s loyalty.  There is little need to search for
greener pastures when there is a possibility to grow with a company. 
This is of course provided the other hygiene factors are met.  People
will feel more valued when you invest in them, and in return, they will
be more likely to stay loyal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well
enough so they don’t want to</strong>.” – <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/10/03/sir-richard-branson/">Richard
Branson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There any many other benefits to training people, with a more
quantifiable one being the ability to deduct the expense from tax.
Enabling growth and innovation as a result of training also has the
likelihood of extending the organization’s lifespan.</p>
<p>Although there are many more benefits to training, like the ability
to be more productive and able to deliver better service, let’s move on
to what training typically looks like in an ‘orange’ organization.</p>
<h2 id="orange-training">Orange training</h2>
<p>In a more traditional ‘orange’ organization, training is usually
carefully curated by the Human Resources team.  It is often only
available to top performers or those identified for future leadership
roles.   Training is closely linked to a specific role, and success is
commonly measured by obtaining a certificate.  It is treated as a
once-off investment.</p>
<p>The key characteristics of typical ‘orange’ onboarding include:</p>
<h3 id="external-usually-off-site">1. external, usually off-site</h3>
<p>Training is typically provided by an external training provider that
specializes in one area or skill. The training is usually off-site at
the training provider.</p>
<p>As training is done by an external party, it is usually rather
general. If, for example, a team attends Scrum training, the trainer
teaches the specifics of the Scrum framework without taking into
consideration the organization’s internal dynamics and ways of working. 
Whether you are an engineering manager or an HR professional, the
contents are the same.</p>
<p>On the upside, this means you get a more pure perspective of a topic.
On the downside, however, few people can apply these general skills back
in the workplace. The work environment and structures are often very
different from what was described in the blue sky training environment. 
To start using the knowledge gained, the existing ways of working need
to be adapted, and few organizations prioritize this after training.</p>
<h3 id="selection-based-on-accreditation">2. Selection based on
accreditation</h3>
<p>Human Resources is often responsible for finding training providers
and suitable courses. They curate a list of reputable training
providers.  Often the primary selection criteria are to evaluate
accreditation to certification bodies. While the benefit of this
approach is that the training adheres to industry standards, it doesn’t
guarantee good <em>quality</em> content.  Only <em>coverage</em> of
content.</p>
<h3 id="completion-measures-success">3. Completion measures Success</h3>
<p>Success is usually measured on course completion in a predominantly
‘orange’ paradigm. Once you’ve completed a course, you are rewarded with
a certificate or label to proudly add to your profile or resume.</p>
<p>Most training providers test competence in a written exam format
after completing classroom training.</p>
<h2 id="teal-training">Teal training</h2>
<p>An organization operating from a mainly teal paradigm treats training
as an ongoing investment. Compared to an ‘orange’ paradigm, where the
certification marks the completion of the investment, in a ‘teal’
paradigm, certification makes the <em>beginning</em> of the
investment.</p>
<p>For more on my perspective on the training process, you might also
read <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-10-18-redefining-the-learning-process/">“Redefining
the learning process”</a>.  The key takeaway is that obtaining a
certification is a tool for awareness.  It allows you to ask the right
questions, but it doesn’t guarantee competence.  That takes
practice.</p>
<p>Below are the key characteristics in more detail:</p>
<h3 id="hands-on-and-contextual">1. Hands-on and contextual</h3>
<p>Training in a ‘teal’ operating paradigm is often in-house and more
hands-on than a typical ‘orange’ operating paradigm. Rather than go to
an external training provider, a training provider is asked to adapt the
material to be more specific to the organization.</p>
<p>Training is specific to the team or organization rather than generic,
as in an ‘orange’ paradigm.  There is more context surrounding the
training topic that aims to bridge the theoretical knowledge and the
practical application thereof.</p>
<h3 id="evidence-measures-success">2. Evidence measures success</h3>
<p>A key difference between ‘orange’ and ‘teal’ is how success is
measured.</p>
<p>In a predominantly ‘teal’ organization, success is measured by the
ability to <em>apply</em> the newly gained skill or knowledge in
different situations. Having the certification isn’t enough.  After
completing the course, the team is typically asked to apply their newly
gained skills in a practical project.  For more on this perspective, I
recommend reading <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-10-18-5-steps-towards-mastery-in-learning/">“5
Steps towards Mastery in Learning</a>“.</p>
<p>There is space and time allocated to experiment and reflect after
training finishes. The people that went on training will plan and
implement an experiment on a real project to practice and integrate
their new skills.  They will reflect on the learnings – both what worked
and what didn’t – and demo the results to other team members.</p>
<p>This means people extend their investment to others in the
organization, compounding the value.  More collaboratively, skills get
cross-pollinated when people and teams openly share their successes and
failures.</p>
<h3 id="selected-by-people">3. Selected by people</h3>
<p>Certifications and accreditation become less important in a ‘teal’
operating paradigm. Experience is far more important than
certifications.  The people also own their training path and have a
dedicated personal budget. They have the freedom to choose how to
spend.</p>
<p>Each person is responsible for their personal development.  They
might choose to spend their training budget on attending conferences, or
maybe they prefer to buy books.  Maybe they most enjoy attending formal
classroom sessions or enrolling in degree programs.  Or maybe they
choose to work with one coach while another prefers someone else.  Each
person has the freedom to make their own choices, supported by the
organization.  The emphasis moves from dictating and controlling to
supporting and nurturing.</p>
<p>When group training requires a minimum amount of people, people
self-organize to find other interested people.  They may also opt to
give one person the responsibility to facilitate and organize training
as in a more typical ‘orange’ environment, with the difference being
that they have the freedom to change this decision and structure when it
no longer works for them.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>The main difference between training in a predominantly ‘orange’
paradigm and a ‘teal’ one relates to being more practical and
collaborative. Below is a possible roadmap to transition to a more teal
way of training.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-demos">1. Introduce demos</h3>
<p>The first item to meaningfully focus on is to introduce space and
time for people to showcase and share their learnings with others within
the organization.</p>
<p>After completing training, give people adequate time to apply their
new skills on an actual project facilitated by their coach or <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/10/15/key-elements-of-mentoring/">mentor</a>. 
Schedule a team demo where they could share the new talent and show the
benefit by comparing a before and after scenario. The demo could include
a hypothesis, what was done, what worked, what didn’t work and how it
was solved.</p>
<p>Another example of the concept of demos is hackathons, where people
can work on any project of their choice, showing the results at the end
of the hackathon.  The goal of these hackathons is more that of
exploration and what could be.</p>
<p>The key, however, is to share knowledge by showing rather than
telling.</p>
<h3 id="allocate-a-personal-training-budget">2. Allocate a personal
training budget</h3>
<p>The next step is to distribute the central training budget to
individuals and, with that, the responsibilities surrounding
training.</p>
<p>The policies and procedures might need to be updated. At a minimum,
include what is acceptable to spend money on and what is not and when to
initiate the decision-making process.  For example, you might conclude
that anyone can choose any training of their choice as long as they can
show a benefit or improvement in their work productivity.  For other
companies, it might be that if any training is selected that doesn’t
directly support an employee’s primary role, they need to initiate the
decision-making process.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-shared-knowledge-repository">3. Create a shared
knowledge repository</h3>
<p>As a ‘teal’ organization leverages the knowledge of the whole,
creating a shared knowledge repository is essential for long-term
success. This is also the most challenging part of the transition, thus
making sense to do it last.  Once the process is streamlined and
working, start solidifying the outputs in a more long-lasting
structure.  Attempting this too early might restrict you from something
better in the future; thus, be patient.</p>
<p>Create a shared space where people can share and review their
learnings. It might be a Dribble-like website with images and videos of
learning projects. Or it might be a searchable community like the
VSCode, Figma or Miro shared resource library. It might simply be a
dedicated Notion site or internal wiki.  Or a shared Google Drive with
free format content.</p>
<p>The key is that the objective and benefits of the training are
clear.  It is also important that others can comment on and review it. 
Ideally, make it possible to filter successful experiments and
improvements based on a problem or keyword.  The more one solution is
re-used in the organization, the more valuable the results from the
training.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Teal organizations democratize learning. It becomes a shared
experience where people can learn and teach <em>together</em>. The focus
is less on obtaining certifications and more on <em>applying</em> the
skills to improve the quality of work and productivity. Success is
measured by tangible results and how learning a new skill improves the
quality of service or delivery.</p>
<p>The goal is to invest in the organization’s people, which ultimately
leads to the success of the organization. Training is seen as a way to
achieve the organizational purpose, with freedom regarding how
individuals will do this.</p>

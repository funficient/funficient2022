<p>We’ve all experienced it. Those meetings that drag on forever and
eventually you walk out more confused than before.  Or the colleague who
loves his own voice so much that he doesn’t give anyone else a chance to
speak.</p>
<p>From my experience meetings are the biggest source of <a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/solving-the-biggest-waste-in-agile-b5d9186364fb">waste</a>
in many organizations. They are, in fact, one of the biggest barriers to
<a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2018/12/31/3-reasons-your-productivity-improvements-dont-work/">productivity</a>
in many workplaces.  Meetings are, however, essential for effective
communication and decision making — the two primary reasons for any
organization to exist in the first place.   When meetings are done right
they have the ability to engage, motivate and improve collaboration like
nothing else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meetings can be the medicine or the poison to improve, or destroy,
productivity and collaboration in the workplace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you google “effective meetings” there are many articles on how
to make meetings more productive. <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/5-ways-to-play-lean-coffee-bded05853562">Lean
Coffee</a>, for example, is an agile approach specifically designed to
optimize meetings. This lean approach to meetings assumes that the
people who show up for a meeting are the right people. It draws up an
agenda on the spot, without any preparation needed asking participants
what they want to talk about. No agenda is forced upon anyone, resulting
in discussion only relevant to the attendees. It also provides a
structure to ensure movement – a necessary, but often overlooked –
aspect of effective meetings.</p>
<p>It does, however, not guarantee removing the biggest obstacle to
effective meetings, namely ego.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-obstacle-to-effective-meetings">The biggest obstacle
to effective meetings</h2>
<p>Ego shows up when people have a personal agenda rather than
collaborating for what’s best for the organization. An ego-driven
meeting is usually lead or overpowered by one person.  Usually, someone
who is primarily there to <strong>convince</strong> the rest of their
plan or idea, not to decide on the best plan collaboratively.</p>
<p>It’s the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/03/08/failed-leadership-elephant-room/">elephant
in the room</a> that no-one <em>can</em> talk about because it’s not
something tangible that can be discussed.  Often, the domineering party
is the authority figure, making it hard to challenge or question.
Ego-driven discussion is a hidden intention and at best it’s a guess to
discern whether your intuition is in fact right or clouded by your
personal biases.</p>
<p>And if you can’t admit to the elephant in the room, you’re not able
to do anything about it. <em>Or can you?</em></p>
<h2 id="thinking-efficiently-with-the-6-thinking-hats">Thinking
efficiently with the 6 Thinking Hats</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.edwdebono.com/about">Edward de Bono</a>, with a
degree in medicine, psychology and physiology, was interested in how we
think. He has written a number of books on thinking, with one dedicated
to the 6 Thinking Hats.  He proposed that thinking is a skill that can
be learned, not something you were born with.    Also he coined the term
<strong>lateral thinking</strong>, more commonly known as creative
thinking. He created a set of tools to intentionally generate innovate
and new ideas. Another form of thinking he coined is called
<strong>parallel thinking</strong>*, more generally known as critical
thinking.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-thinking">Parallel thinking</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.debonogroup.com/parallel_thinking.php">Parallel
thinking</a> is a simple, yet effective tool to align the thinking in
the room.  It can be compared to the lean manufacturing concept of
one-piece-flow for the mind.  It provides an alternative to argument as
a means of reaching consensus within a group.</p>
<p>Often, everyone is at a different place in their thinking process and
has a different perspective.  The majority of the time and energy is
spent on trying to get everyone on the same page rather than decision
making.</p>
<p>Often an entire hour is spent going around in circles with no
agreement reached within the group.  Parallel thinking attempts to
create some order in this chaotic thinking process, much like a defined
value stream simplifies and orders the process of developing products
and services to make it more productive.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-hats">6 Thinking Hats</h3>

<p>When everyone focuses on the same area at the same time, progress is
made much faster with little room for the ego to dominate the meeting. 
The 6 Thinking Hats is a practical application of the concept of
parallel thinking, where each different color hat represents a different
thinking direction.</p>
<p>Using the six thinking hats** method of thinking, the facilitator
may, for example, request everyone to dedicate a set time to only focus
on white-hat thinking.  During this time, everyone in the room focuses
only on the facts and information surrounding the topic.  Questions like
<em>“What do we know about this topic?”</em> or <em>“What information do
we need and how can we get it?”</em> is asked.  The focus is solely
focused on information, without any benefits, risks, emotions or options
to distract the thinking.</p>
<p>When someone attempts to distract the conversation by mentioning
anything that is not factual and directly contributing to the
information-focus, like expressing emotions or risks which might steer
the conversation in a different direction, the facilitator explains that
there will be time to focus on these aspects later and gently guides
them back to focus on the topic of discussion.</p>
<p>Once the information has been unpacked adequately, the entire group
is requested to focus on the next thinking style, for example exploring
alternatives (green hat thinking), or looking at risks (black hat
thinking).</p>
<p>Each metaphorical hat is worn in sequence, or as the need arises, to
align the focus of thinking. <em>Read more about the <a
href="http://www.debonogroup.com/six_thinking_hats.php">Six Thinking
Hats</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="focused-meetings-are-effective-meetings">Focused meetings are
effective meetings</h2>
<p>The key to more productive and focused meetings is the underlying
concept of parallel thinking used in the 6 Thinking Hats.  Although the
6 Thinking Hats is a general framework that can be used in most
meetings, the principle of parallel thinking can be applied anywhere,
depending on the need.</p>
<p>For example, parallel thinking can be used when doing a <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/free-business-tools/pestle/">PESTEL
analysis</a> by breaking down each of the distinct focus areas into a
specific focus area similar to the 6 colored hats.  Everyone in the
meeting only focuses on the political drivers, then move their attention
to the economic factors, then the social factors etc.</p>
<p>By focusing the discussion on desired outcomes – one at a time –
there is little room for ego. When the ego does pop up, people are able
to overrule these ego-driven discussions with an objective and
non-threatening tool. And when everyone is able to contribute equally,
decisions are more effective as there is automatic buy-in.  Meetings are
shorter, and the productive actions after the meetings improve. To focus
on thinking, even more, try to use tangible artefacts such as cards or a
cube.</p>

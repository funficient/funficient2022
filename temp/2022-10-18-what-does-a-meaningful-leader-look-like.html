<h1 class="title">What does a meaningful leader look like?</h1>

<p>Deep down, we all yearn to be seen and heard. We strive to become an
authority figure, whether it is as the CEO of a big organization, or the
cherished father of a child. But what makes a meaningful and inspiring
leader? And what do you need to become an everyday leader, as
<strong>Drew Dudley</strong> talks about in his <a
href="http://www.ted.com/talks/drew_dudley_everyday_leadership">TED Talk
about everyday leadership</a>?</p>
<h1 id="ask-questions">1. Ask questions</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Of course I follow the people, am I not their leader?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote above as well as the TED talk both start with a question.
That is no coincidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A meaningful leader is not afraid to ask meaningful questions, or
admit that they don’t know all the answers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A meaningful leader realizes that in order to be part of something
bigger than yourself, you have to surround yourself with people that
know more than you on a subject and you’re not afraid to admit it, or
listen to other’s advice or opinions.</p>
<p>A meaningful leader realizes that you don’t have to know it all.</p>
<h1 id="listen-and-react">2. Listen and react</h1>
<p>There has been a lot of emphasis lately on the importance of
listening, and it continues to be one of the most important skills of a
meaningful leader.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But listening without action, is the same as not listening at
all.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A meaningful leader doesn’t only listen open-heartedly, they react
and respond appropriately. They are not afraid to say <em>“I don’t know
yet”</em>, or <em>“I’ll have to think about it”</em>, as they realize
immediate action is often only addressing a symptom that is part of a
bigger problem, and that a longterm solution requires careful
consideration before taking action.</p>
<p>A meaningful leader takes time to think about what was said before
responding, and she takes multiple viewpoints and perspectives into
consideration before acting with confidence.</p>
<p>A meaningful leader takes careful, well thought through action at the
appropriate time, action that empowers and supports and which is well
within the comfort zone of the followers.</p>
<h1 id="be-congruent">3. Be congruent</h1>
<p>Actions speak louder than words. Meaningful leadership is about
saying what you do, and doing what you say. It’s about living and
demonstrating integrity at all times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What you <strong>think</strong>, what you <strong>say</strong>,
and what you <strong>do</strong> must at all time be aligned in order to
demonstrate meaningful leadership.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People don’t do what you say, they do what you do. When you as a
leader demonstrate integrity, you inspire people to follow you, rather
than demanding their respect.</p>
<p>A meaningful leader understands that he teaches not knowledge and
information, but values. And values can not be taught by words or be
demanded, it is earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyday leadership demands honesty and vulnerability, not knowledge
and power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A meaningful leader, whether it is the head of a big organization or
the head of a household, is someone who lives in integrity, leading by
example and inspiring, not demanding. A meaningful leader listens to the
needs of his people and reacts thoughtfully, after careful
consideration.</p>
<p>So what will it take for you to become a meaningful leader?</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="the-future-of-agile">The future of agile</h2>
<p><em>First there was agile. Then there was teal.</em></p>
<p>Agile is fast maturing and its time to look at <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/whats-next-9670b01d8fbc">what’s
next</a>. In my opinion, it’s called teal. Agile, but more. But first, a
short walk down memory lane to get some context.</p>
<h2 id="remember-the-future">Remember the Future</h2>
<p>Agile took the world by storm and Scrum quickly became more
synonymous with software development than rugby. Scrum Masters popped up
like cosmos flowers after the first summer rains, polluting the software
development job boards as the need for more agile organizations
grew.</p>
<p><img

<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/service/terms/#usage">I</a>mage from
Pixabay.</p>
<p>The word Scrum (to me that is) implies separate teams pushing against
each other with the strongest team winning, the other team being the
loser. There can be only one winner, with the most agile on the field
the most likely to win.</p>
<p>In the background, however, a much more subtler, softer shade of
agile has been growing for the past decade or more called <em>teal</em>
with companies like Patagonia, Buurtzorg and SoundsTrue a few of the
super successful examples. These companies all have one thing in common
— better than expected return on investment and continuous, long-term
growth.</p>
<p>More like the gentle lavender fields, it takes much more care and
nurturing to grow compared to the weed-like cosmos which grows wild next
to the road in rural South Africa, exploding in splashes of pink and
white as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p><img

<p>The word teal to me implies integration (blue <strong>and</strong>
green), wisdom, freedom, power, together, tranquil — the color I most
associate with the vast open skies or the palegic ocean.</p>
<h1 id="teal-time">Teal Time</h1>
<p>Software development and good coffee to me is like salt and pepper —
an undeniably excellent partnership. I haven’t met a technology geek who
doesn’t love good coffee. It’s just one of those small little unwritten
rules if you want to be part of the technology club. If there was to be
an ad for the typical persona on a dating website for technology geeks,
there will be stipulated:</p>
<p><em>“Must love good coffee.”</em></p>
<p><em>Agility and caffeine just goes well together it seems. It’s fast,
exciting, and changes direction quickly. The stronger, the better. It
kicks you into action if you’re procrastinating or bored and it fuels
the fires while you burn the midnight candles to get the release out the
door.</em></p>
<p><a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/a-teal-manifesto-68347d90957">Teal</a>,
on the other hand, is much more comparable like tea-time. It’s gentler,
softer, slower. <em>Teal is more about human connection, wholeness,
purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>Where agile can be compared to a smooth running machine where
each spoke is well-oiled and running at optimum speed, teal can be
compared to a delicate living organism. It’s more sensitive to the
surroundings and needs time to rest and restore, like all living things.
It can’t run on optimal power for extended periods of time like a
machine, but it can think for itself and service itself when needed and
before it breaks down.</em> This eco-system needs to be nurtured and is
always in search of equilibrium, compared to an engine in search of
optimization. Where Scrum often aims to do everything faster, better,
more, Teal aims keep these forces in balance with a continuous
improvement culture.</p>
<h2 id="teal-vs-agile-a-rough-guide">Teal vs Agile — a Rough Guide</h2>
<p>There are more differences than an be mentioned in one post, but on a
high level, here are the top five elements that differentiates agile
from teal, taking into consideration that teal inherently means that a
company is fully agile. However, an agile company is not guaranteed to
be teal.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-agility">1. Organizational agility</h2>
<p>Agility originated when developers realized they’re not able to meet
expectations if they’re so tightly managed and controlled in a
super-structured waterfall approach, run by control and demand of the
managers.</p>
<p>With agile, these development teams were given a little more freedom
in a less structured Scrum team where they were encouraged to report to
each other rather than a team lead, take ownership of their workload and
provide more input into estimations, amongst others. The rest of the
organization however remained as structured and controlled as
before.</p>
<p>A difference between agile and teal is that agile is focused on the
software delivery process, one part at a time mostly, whereas teal
expands towards organizational agility, including not only the software
delivery process, but the supporting processes too as a whole. Teal
organizations are not limited to software development or technology, but
can be applied equally to a farm, a building site, a law firm, a bank or
a software development house.</p>
<h2 id="no-standardization">2. No Standardization</h2>
<p>Scrum aims to standardize work — again driven by the control-and
demanding leadership style that drives it. The process is standardized,
the workflow (to-do, in progress, done) is standardized, even the
ceremonies and schedule for these ceremonies are standardized. The only
freedom the team has is often choosing the sprint duration.</p>
<p>Teal, on the other hand, doesn’t standardize anything. Rather, it
relies on good cross-functional communication and includes an advisory
process and a conflict resolution process to ensure alignment between
different teams and the organizational purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What is more important than standardization is good communication
and an organizational team spirit.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="coaching-rather-than-consulting">3. Coaching rather than
Consulting</h2>
<p>Scrum and agile generally relies on consulting as teaching mechanism.
Each team has a Scrum Master or Agile Coach who’s role it is to make
sure that the team understands and follows the process.</p>
<p>Typically, a Scrum Master will be asked what to do in a specific
situation and the response will be advise based on experience.
Basically, it’s telling the team what the answer is or what to try.</p>
<p><em>Teal, on the other hand, takes coaching to the next level. The
management team is replaced by team coaches. Agile coaches and Scrum
Masters become team coaches, driving change and establishing equilibrium
within a team.</em></p>
<p>The role of the team coach is to maintain harmony within an entire
team by asking the right questions to help guide the thinking of the
team, without ever giving a direct answer.</p>
<p>As apposed to pointing out the problem to the team that, for example,
the CEO is talking too much or demanding too long sessions at a time,
the team coach will notice the issue, then ask the team what they notice
or how they feel or what they think they should do next in an attempt to
raise their awareness to identify problems themselves.</p>
<p>It’s like the typical dialog between <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118303/">Dharma &amp; Greg</a> where
a question is always answered with a question.</p>
<p><em>Greg: “Do you think I should quit my job?”</em></p>
<p><em>Dharma: “I don’t know, what do you think? Do you think you should
you quit your job?”</em></p>
<p>The world of coaching started with individual coaching, yet team
coaching is fast becoming the norm. A team coach is all about getting
the team as a whole to function together whereas a personal coach is
about developing a single person at a time, outside the context of the
team he or she works in. Teal adds context and more perspectives to a
problem, enabling solutions to be discovered exponentially faster than
what is possible in an individual session.</p>
<h2 id="inclusive-rather-than-exclusive">4. Inclusive rather than
Exclusive</h2>
<p>Agile, or Scrum, is commonly viewed as a competition, where different
teams are compared to each other to see who the ‘best’ performer is,
much like the word “scrum” implies. That is like comparing the heart to
the liver in a human body, trying to see which one is the better one,
while both are equally important, just for different reasons. You can’t
live without either.</p>
<p>Teal organizations view the entire organization as a living organism
where each part is as necessary as the next. They even go one step
further and include the suppliers and customers and even competitors in
their goal to maintain equilibrium. They understand that there’s no
business if there’s no suppliers or customers, as there is no business
without employees.</p>
<p>Teal organizations seek strategic partnerships and win-win
relationships between everyone involved. It’s an intersection of needs
and wants based on a shared purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s not teal if everyone doesn’t win.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="happiness-matters">5. Happiness matters</h2>
<p>In agile organizations the emphasis is mainly on delivery, whatever
it takes. It matters that the customers are happy and it matters that
the shareholders are happy, but when employees are unhappy, it is the
individual that often is expected to change.</p>
<p>In teal organizations, the primary measure for success is happiness.
If the workers aren’t happy it is considered a serious problem that
needs to be addressed. It’s not acceptable for the leader to enforce his
ideas or rules on the workers, rather, it is a collaborative, inclusive
creation. Where the general leadership style in agile organizations are
still demand-and control, the general leadership style in teal
organizations are more free, compassionate and empowering.</p>
<p>The unhappiness is viewed as an indication that something is not
working, with the assumption that the worker is the best informed person
to know when something needs to change. Employee happiness becomes one
of the most important measures of the organization’s success, as teal
organizations understand that happy people do good work, they are more
engaged and thus more productive and innovative.</p>

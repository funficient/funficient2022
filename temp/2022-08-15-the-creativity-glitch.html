    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="a-tale-of-creation">A tale of creation</h2>
<p><em>Being a creative mind is hard. It’s not as linear and planned as
an engineering- or science-minded life. It is more like the ebb and flow
of an ocean. Or the waxing and waning of the moon. Or the glitch which
turns into art.</em></p>
<p>Two creative minds — <em><a
href="http://www.janaandkoos.studio/">Jana and Koos</a></em> — shared
their creative journey, taking us through the ups and downs of the
creative process at a <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/IO-Powwow/events/241905903/">meetup</a> in
Cape Town this week hosted by the IO PowWow team talks. They shared
their creative process in building a brand from scratch, first looking
at a project that was hard, followed by an easier one, sharing their
insights and how they fuel their creative fire.</p>
<p>Born in a half artist, half engineer family myself, listening to
their process of creation made me feel a bit more normal. For me, the
creative process is most painful before it is most delightful. And as we
journeyed with them from coming up with a brand new name to refining the
final pieces of the puzzle of their creative work, time stood still for
an hour.</p>
<p>Many insights were shared, but these were the ones that stood out
most for me and can be applied to anyone — designer, artist, engineer,
or just a normal human being:</p>
<h2 id="insight-1-its-not-art-if-its-not-personal">Insight #1: It’s not
art if it’s not personal</h2>
<p>Copying or reproducing is easy — <em>relatively that is</em> of
course. Creating something original is much harder. Creating something
original <em>and</em> something that delights the customer — a rare find
indeed.</p>
<p>The secret to delightful <em>and</em> original art is about getting
personal and really knowing your customer intimately. It’s taking the
time to go through the small little details of the work. It’s noticing
the customer’s quirky sense of humor which makes them uniquely
<em>them</em>. It’s understanding their likes and dislikes, seeing their
distinctive footprint in the world, noticing what is often taken for
granted by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To delight, art has to be personal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="insight-2-creativity-requires-fun">Insight # 2: Creativity
requires fun</h2>
<p>The most creative and delightful creations are born when you’re most
relaxed. It’s the crazy idea that everyone laughs at that becomes the
<em>wow!</em> design. It’s the accidental stumbled upon design that
becomes the most entrancing.</p>
<p>Constant stress, deadlines and being busy is the enemy of truly
unique art. It takes slack time to be creative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s the dance between tight deadlines and the void of
nothingness that nurtures creativity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="insight-3-always-say-yes">Insight #3: Always say yes</h2>
<p>Much like the creative process itself, work comes and goes in ebb an
flow. When work is flowing, <em>always</em> say yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Outsource and partner with the right people at the right time,
but never say never.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Art is a team sport. It works better together. When it flows, go with
the flow. When the flow stop, relax and smell the flowers along the way.
Or otherwise put, make hay while the sun shines.</p>
<h2 id="insight-4-the-devil-is-in-the-details">Insight #4: The devil is
in the details</h2>
<p>Customers know what they like but it’s hard to articulate or describe
something that hasn’t been created yet. Reading minds is a skill that
most people don’t have, so to gather feedback, context is everything.
Show a many options as possible.</p>
<p>It’s the scatter cushion with the printed design that evokes the
<em>hell yes!</em> response, not the one logo you think is best or most
suited. It’s the inclusion of the optical illusion in every little
detail, from the bar design to the labels that gives life to a brand, as
<a href="https://www.meshclub.co.za/4pmatmesh/">M E S H</a> can attest.
It’s <em>showing</em>, not telling, within context, how the brand will
look like.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>80% creation, 20% production.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2
id="insight-5-dont-stop-until-youre-proud-and-the-customer-is-awed">Insight
#5: Don’t stop until you’re proud <em>AND</em> the customer is awed</h2>
<p>Most people stop working on a project when the time is over or the
money is up. Some, slightly more admiring and daring ones, don’t stop
until they’re proud. But it’s a rare gem to discover a partnership who
don’t stop until they’re proud <em>and</em> the customer is delighted.
Not just happy, but absolutely delighted.</p>
<p>Jana and Koos does nothing the same twice, and they don’t stop until
they’re proud. Showing us the hundreds of samples and options that went
into one of the harder projects is evidence of the secret to success in
design or any other form of art.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The difference between average and awesome.
Perseverance.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2
id="final-thoughts-and-ebracing-the-glitch-in-the-creative-process">Final
thoughts and ebracing the glitch in the creative process…</h2>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SMwVlXfRAkhDqBbVntMx9g.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Keep an eye on the <a
href="http://www.janaandkoos.studio/freeart">website</a> for their
newest project, a collection of free high quality art with a distinctive
and different spin.</p>
<p>Share in the fun by creating your own, or enjoy what they create
running respected artist’s work through glitch apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mistakes are often blessings in disguise.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which concludes my final insight from the meetup in a lesson I’ve
been trying to learn the past few months — namely allowing people to
make mistakes.</p>
<p>Most people build fences to keep out the hurt because that’s the easy
option.</p>
<p>Yet, one of the most compassionate things you can do is to forgive
someone who’s made a mistake that hurt you. It’s also one of the hardest
things to do. It means you allow someone to hurt you.</p>
<p>But once you’ve forgiven, you realize it was no mistake after all. It
was just the process of creating something even more beautiful and
unique.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It takes a true artist to embrace mistakes.</em></p>
</blockquote>

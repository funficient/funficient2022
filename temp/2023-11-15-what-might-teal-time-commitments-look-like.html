    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>How a time commitment is approached in an organization predominantly
operating from a teal paradigm is very different from how a
predominantly ‘orange’ organization operates. An organization operating
from a predominantly orange paradigm sets the time commitment in the
initial contract. Processes, salaries, and benefits are almost always
expecting a full-time commitment from employees. Flexibility around time
commitments is mostly unheard of. An organization operating from a
mainly teal paradigm handles time commitments very differently.</p>
<p>This post outlines the importance of a time commitment related to
productivity from a teal paradigm perspective.  It also proposes an
alternative approach to productivity without full-time time commitments
from employees.</p>

</ul>
<p>But first, let’s take a step back and understand the characteristics
of a time commitment and how it relates to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/07/most-productive-thing/">productivity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-productivity">What is productivity?</h2>
<p>When I asked <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/09/03/leverage-chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>
to define productivity in one sentence, this is what it came up
with:<br />
<em>“Productivity is the effective use of your time and resources to
accomplish tasks and goals efficiently.”</em></p>
<p>Time is an essential foundation of anything associated with
productivity as most people understand it. Another definition of
productivity from <a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/productivity.asp">Investopedia</a>
states that <em>“At the corporate level, productivity is a measure of
the efficiency of a company’s production process, it is calculated by
measuring the number of units produced relative to employee labour hours
or by measuring a company’s net sales relative to employee labour
hours.”</em></p>
<p>Again time is the baseline for calculating productivity in the
workplace according to them.  As a result of this definition of
productivity many, if not most, companies tend to rely on time sheets
and time in general to optimize their organizational productivity.</p>
<p>All of this of course makes sense, provided you are clear on the
goal.  If the goal is purpose-driven, as in the case of organizations
operating from a predominantly teal paradigm, time isn’t necessarily the
best way to measure productivity.  But first, let’s look at time in a
bit more depth.</p>
<h2 id="about-time">About time</h2>
<p>Time is the one constant thing about our world. We can rely on the
fact that every day will last 24 hours day will always be followed by
night. Without any exception. Time is a law of the earth much like
gravity.</p>
<p>Many people, however, don’t spend a lot of time thinking about time. 
Here are some characteristics of time to provide more context as to how
it relates to productivity in the age of knowledge workers:</p>
<h3 id="you-cant-save-time">1. You can’t save time</h3>
<p>Time is arguably the most valuable resource available to us. Every
big company knows this and actively looks for ways to hold your
attention, and thus time.  There is, however, one big misunderstanding
when it comes to time.  You can’t save time.</p>
<p>It’s not possible to spend time you didn’t use today later. As a
limited resource, time can only be spent. It can’t be saved.</p>
<p>The perception in many cases is that the faster you do something, the
more productive you are.  This perception, however, isn’t always true.
Just because you did something faster doesn’t mean you did the
<em>right</em> thing.  Often people ‘save’ time by doing something
faster simply to have to go back again at a later stage to correct what
was missed with the first fast delivery.  In the end, you never saved
any time, you merely postponed when you spent it.  Or worst case, you
wasted it by spending it on the <em>wrong</em> thing.</p>
<h3 id="time-is-useful-to-measure-progress">2. Time is useful to measure
progress</h3>
<p>Another key characteristic of time is that it is useful to measure
progress. You can’t go back in time. You can only move forward in time.
If you don’t use your time on any day, you stand still on the
metaphorical progress line.</p>
<p>Time allows you to know where you are in relation to where you were,
and where you want to go.  Without a clear goal, any time you spend is
unproductive.  You might be busy, but that is no guarantee that you are
moving towards your goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-enables-face-to-face-meetings">3. Time enables face-to-face
meetings</h3>
<p>While you might randomly bump into someone in your local
neighbourhood, doing business globally requires that you agree on a
specific time to connect. Time is the tool that allows two people’s
realities to intersect or come together.</p>
<p>Time is useful to allow two or more people to meet. It’s a social
agreement between two or more people that enables human connection.</p>
<h3 id="it-always-takes-longer-than-planned">4. It always takes longer
than planned</h3>
<p>People are notoriously bad at planning. Whenever I speak to a
seasoned project manager and ask them about their ability to deliver on
time, the answer is nearly never. On average all projects take about 20%
longer than anticipated. Humans tend to overestimate their ability to do
something.</p>
<p>This means that time is more useful as a marker in relation to where
you want to be than absolute goals in many cases.  It’s ready when it’s
ready.  Or it’s ready when you decide that you don’t want to spend any
more time and are willing to accept the risk of delivering.</p>
<h3 id="time-is-a-cycle-not-a-straight-line">5. Time is a cycle, not a
straight line</h3>
<p>Rather than looking at time as a finite, straight line, it’s a cycle.
The cycle of time, like the clock, goes around rather than in one
straight line.  There’s always another Monday.  There’s always another
January.  Also, there’s always another year.  There’s always another
opportunity.  When you view products or services in this circular way,
you can more easily focus on what’s most important right now rather than
try to finish everything at once.</p>
<p>Time is one aspect of a more complex design of life. The cycle of
life relates to time, but time doesn’t guarantee a specific result. <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/12/10/how-to-renew-yourself-in-nature/">In
nature</a>, for example, a seed doesn’t flower based on a schedule. It
flowers when the conditions are right. There needs to be enough
sunshine, water, quality soil, pollinating insects, air, <em>and
time</em>, for a seed to grow into a flower. Even when all these
elements are in place it doesn’t guarantee that all seeds will
flower.</p>
<p>Time is a cycle.  It isn’t one-dimensional as we tend to look at
it.</p>
<h3 id="results-are-not-proportionate-to-effort">6. Results are not
proportionate to effort</h3>
<p>In the book <a
href="https://www.systems-thinkers.org/resources/resource/the_art_of_systems_thinking">“The
Art of Systems Thinking”</a> the author explains that <em>“…you can get
a big change for a small effort when you know the leverage point.”</em>
Conversely, also, you can spend a lot of effort without any results when
you don’t understand the system.</p>
<p>When you look at an organization as a living system, it’s not about
the amount of effort but <em>where</em> you spend the effort that
determines your productivity. To change a system you need to find the
balancing and reinforcing loops. Time alone is not an effective measure
of productivity.</p>
<h3 id="inspiration-requires-relaxation">7. Inspiration requires
relaxation</h3>
<p>It is no coincidence that most inventions in the world were either a
result of an accident, like the discovery of penicillin and Post-it
notes, or came to someone while they were taking a shower, walking, or
simply relaxing.  Creative ideas can only be perceived when you’re
relaxed.  It happens in the absence of being busy.</p>
<p>When you fully occupy your mind with busy work, it’s hard to come up
with original ideas. Inspiration requires a relaxed mind free from
thought or time constraints.  Like a cluttered home doesn’t have space
for new articles, so too a cluttered mind doesn’t have space for new
ideas and inspiration.</p>
<p>A typical ‘orange’ organization, which roughly came to being at the
start of the Industrial Revolution, requires optimization around time.
To build cars in a factory, for example, you needed to make the best
possible use of daylight time. Workers’ <em>hands</em> were the resource
most valued.</p>
<p>In the knowledge era, we are no longer bound by daylight to be
productive. Our most valuable resource today is our <em>mind</em>, not
our hands. For knowledge workers to be productive, they need time to
relax.</p>
<h2 id="a-teal-approach-to-productivity">A teal approach to
productivity</h2>
<p>With these properties of time in mind, let’s re-look at productivity
and how to measure it in an organization operating from a predominant
teal paradigm.</p>
<p>Most ‘orange’ companies’ primary goal is to make money based on goods
made, like manufacturing cars or clothes. With the primary goal of
making money, it makes sense to sell and measure time. If, however, you
are a purpose-driven organization, the primary measure of productivity
can no longer sufficiently be measured in time. For a purpose driven the
primary measure of success is impact. Profit is a consequence of this
success, not the primary goal.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is an alternative equation to measure
productivity:</p>
<p><em>Productivity = goal x feedback × motivation²</em></p>
<p>First and foremost the goal and purpose need to be clearly defined
and accepted by everyone involved to be considered productive. Second,
you need to find the balancing and reinforcing loops and design feedback
loops around this. Thirdly, human motivation is probably the biggest
factor in an information age where creativity and the ability to learn
is your biggest differentiator.  A motivated person will be able to do
something in a fraction of the time of a demotivated person.</p>
<p>Time isn’t a factor in this equation of productivity. Not that time
becomes unimportant. It might still be useful to measure time on
occasion to understand where the bottleneck in the system is. It does,
however, not have the same importance and focus as in a predominantly
‘orange’ organization.</p>
<h2 id="what-might-teal-time-management-look-like">What might teal time
management look like?</h2>
<p>With this equation for productivity, let’s look at some of the main
characteristics and how time commitment can be handled within an
organization predominantly operating from a teal paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-work">1. Asynchronous work</h3>
<p>There are so many benefits to working in an asynchronous manner that
it deserves a separate post. Being able to focus without interruption
arguably being the most valuable, followed shortly by the ability to
work according to your schedule for maximum productivity.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with working asynchronously, simply put it
means that everyone isn’t online at the same time, and by default, you
don’t expect an immediate response when you ask a question. This does
not mean you never work together, and actually, you have a better chance
of having someone online at odd hours than in a traditional model. It
merely means that you don’t expect to get an immediate answer as is the
case when you are co-located in a physical office.</p>
<p>This of course requires clearly defined outcomes as well as
responsible employees with good communication skills. It also assumes a
clear team agreement and communication plan where everyone explicitly
agrees on when and how to communicate with other team members. Most
importantly, and most valuable in my opinion, it means that employees
need to plan and think things through before asking for help immediately
when they run into a problem.</p>
<p>A predominant ‘teal’ organization (that isn’t customer-facing like a
physical retail store), designs around asynchronous and flexible work
hours.</p>
<h3 id="outcomes-over-time">2. Outcomes over time</h3>
<p>For asynchronous work to be effective, outcomes need to be clearly
defined.  When you can’t keep an eye on employees to see whether they
are contributing or productive, results become even more important than
before. If you get the outcomes you wanted, you have to assume that the
people were contributing and productive.</p>
<p>A predominantly teal organization spend adequate time defining clear
outcomes that are aligned with the organizational purpose and values. 
The <em>why</em> and the <em>what</em> matter more than the
<em>how</em>. The single most important question to ask is <em>“How will
you know you’ve achieved your desired outcome?”</em> What evidence will
there be that the objective has been met? What will people do
differently as a result of the work? What will you see when it’s
done?</p>
<h3 id="value-or-project-based-billing-over-time-based-billing">3. Value
or project-based billing over time-based billing</h3>
<p>A typical ‘orange’ organization defaults to time-based contracts and
billing and full-time employees. Employees are paid for their time and
customers are billed for time spent on a project. In a predominantly
‘teal’ organization, however, the trend moves towards project- or
value-based billing.</p>
<p>Employees are considered trusted partners rather than owned
employees.  Rather than adding the responsibility and risk of employing
a lot of people full-time, there is typically a small core team with an
available resource pool of trusted collaborators that can be called on
as and when needed, as <a
href="https://www.weareneo.com/who-we-are/">Neo</a> does.</p>
<p>A project is either quoted as a fixed amount based on the outcome, or
the value of the project is agreed upon and used as a baseline for
billing. For example, if you help move the needle in a company that
results in a 10 million profit, the value might be a % of the gain. If,
on the other hand, there are no measurable improvements, you might
revert to a much lower fee to cover some basic costs.</p>
<p>The movement is toward <strong>evidence-based billing</strong>.
Traditionally, consultants come into a business with the promise of an
outcome. Regardless of whether the promise is delivered, they still get
paid for their time.  The same is true for employees who get paid for
showing up regardless of what they do. A teal approach puts more
emphasis on the ability to achieve results.  You pay for the outcome
rather than the time.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>Moving from ‘orange’ to ‘teal’ requires taking an initial risk and
building trust over time.  It’s advised to choose a low-risk and small
project to begin with. Once you’ve seen the benefits and have more trust
in the approach can you scale it up to bigger and more projects.</p>
<p>Here is a rough guide to get from ‘orange’ to ‘teal’:</p>
<h3 id="define-the-desired-outcome">1. Define the desired outcome</h3>
<p><em>What do you want?</em> First and foremost the desired outcome
needs to be clearly defined. Coaching can be useful to help clarify the
outcome. If you don’t have a coach you can call on, you can use this <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y0FiWzDBEx3OPg-sMn_LVYaxTZfucRTm/view?usp=drive_link">cheat
sheet</a> to articulate what is called Well Formed Outcomes.</p>
<p>Think about the evidence you will see at the end of a specific time,
the constraints, as well as the budget you have available for this.  The
more tangible an outcome, the higher the probability that you will
achieve it.</p>
<h3 id="manage-expectations">2. Manage expectations</h3>
<p>The next step is to explicitly manage expectations, especially around
a time commitment. How often do you expect the employee to check in with
you? What do you want to know and when? When should they inform you of
slippage? When do you expect them to initiate the advice or
decision-making process?</p>
<p>What happens when they don’t meet these expectations? What are the
consequences?</p>
<p>Collaboratively design a contract to specify the expectations and
desired outcome for each project.  Communicate whether someone is
considered part of the full-time core team or a part-time
collaborator.</p>
<h3 id="ending-a-project">3. Ending a project</h3>
<p>Handling a project termination is the final step to take into
consideration when transitioning to a project or value-based
approach.</p>
<p>When does the project end? Is there a specific end date? Or will the
project only end when the desired outcome has been met? What if you or
the employee wants to terminate the contract before the specified end
date? How do you handle this?</p>
<h2 id="are-you-ready-for-teal">Are you ready for teal?</h2>
<p>Having control over people’s time doesn’t guarantee productivity.  An
organization operating primarily from a teal paradigm is flexible with
its time commitment and focuses on the outcomes rather than the time
spent.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a more teal way of operation doesn’t have to result
in chaos, and it doesn’t have to disrupt the status quo.  The question
is whether the pain of staying where you are is bigger than the pain of
trying something new.</p>
<p>Are you ready to take a step towards a more teal way of operating?

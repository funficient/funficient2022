    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

Work</h1>

<h2 id="unpacking-productivity">Unpacking productivity</h2>
<p>Productivity is the key to improve your quality of life. When you are
more productive, you have more time to do the things you <em>really</em>
want to be doing. The things that make you happy. The things that make
the grind-work bearable.</p>
<p>In business, for example, higher productivity means more sales which
ultimately results in higher profits. Higher profits mean you can pay
higher salaries, get more customers, and make more products to sell.
Additional to the obvious benefits though, there’s also the added
benefit of freeing up your most under-utilized, as well as most
expensive resource – namely human resources – to explore ways to make
your organization even more profitable. Many of Google’s most loved
apps, including Gmail and Google Maps, for example, were born from <a
href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/google-employees-dedicate-20-percent-of-their-time-to-side-projects-heres-how-it-works.html">Google’s
20% innovation time</a> where employees are allowed 20% time to work on
a project of their choice, as long as it benefits the company.</p>
<p>However, when a business is struggling to deliver on their brand
promise, 20% innovation time can be a bad idea to start off your
productivity improvement drive. So what can you do right now to improve
your productivity?</p>
<p>Here are the top 3 reasons your productivity improvements don’t work,
and when you now what doesn’t work, it’s easy to adapt your strategy to
find ways that <em>do</em> work:</p>
<h2 id="youre-measuring-the-thing-wrong">1. You’re measuring the thing
wrong</h2>
<p>One of the most popular methods to improve your productivity is by
improving the efficiency of parts of the system. For example, in
software development, productivity is often measured by the number of
features delivered in a specific time.</p>
<p>In Scrum, velocity is a measure of productivity. <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/velocity/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~&#39;page~&#39;post~&#39;aa_book~&#39;aa_event_session~&#39;aa_experience_report~&#39;aa_glossary~&#39;aa_research_paper~&#39;aa_video)~tags~(~&#39;velocity))~searchTerm~&#39;~sort~false~sortDirection~&#39;asc~page~1)">The
velocity</a> is an indication of how many features (or stories) were
delivered in a specific time-box (or sprint). The higher the velocity,
the more features are delivered, the more productive the system. Or is
it?</p>
<p>What if these features contain a lot of errors requiring the support
team to handle a higher number of issues reported by customers and
require rework and bugfixes in a susequent iteration? Or what if these
features sit in a queue waiting to be deployed in the quarterly release?
Or what if what you delivered isn’t what the customer wanted?</p>
<p><em>Are you really being more productive?</em></p>
<h3 id="the-missing-link">The missing link</h3>
<p>There’s one critical flaw in the calculation to determine
productivity improvement when you look at efficiency of a part. It
doesn’t compare apples with apples. A 10% improvement in the development
process alone does not necessarily result in an overall 10% productivity
improvement.<br />
<br />
Without developed features deployed and used you might have increased
the efficiency of a part, but the productivity of the whole is still
exactly the same, in some cases even worse as a result of the increased
speed or increased waiting time between two different
departments/business units.</p>
<p>To truly measure an improvement in productivity, you have to look at
the whole system within context of value produced. To understand the
improvement you need to obtain a baseline lead time from idea to
delivered. Only when the lead time reduces can you say that your
productivity have increased.</p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram below, by improving the parts you don’t
necessarily improve the whole, and without improving the whole, you’re
not improving. Although all the different parts increased their
efficiency, the customer doesn’t get value delivered to them any
earlier.</p>
<p><img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/false-process-improvement-funficient.jpg" /></p>
<p>You’re as weak as your weakest link. To be able to say you improved
productivity, an increase in efficiency in one area is not enough. You
also need to improve the interaction or handover between the different
parts each time you improve one part of the process to truly be more
productive.</p>
<p><img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/true-process-improvement-funficient.jpg" /></p>
<p>Process improvement can only be truly measured from the point of view
of the customer. If the product or service doesn’t result in delivering
value faster to the customer, you’re not truly improving your
productivity.</p>
<h2 id="youre-measuring-the-wrong-thing">2. You’re measuring the wrong
thing</h2>
<p>As soon as you set a target, people will try their best to meet that
target. Most people want to please their managers and they respect them
enough not to question their motivations for setting specific targets.
Often, it looks like the right measure when looking at a part in
isolation, however, when looking at the whole it becomes clear that
you’re measuring the wrong thing.</p>
<p>The perfect example of this false sense of productivity improvement
by measuring the wrong thing is often observed in call centres.
Productivity is usually measured by decreasing the duration of each
support call and increasing the number of calls handled by each support
call agent. The more calls and the shorter the duration of each call,
the better the efficiency. Or is it?</p>
<p>Is it really more productive when the same customer calls multiple
times because the call centre agent cut off the call as quickly as
possible to meet their targets? Is handling more support calls really
indicative of higher productivity? Or is it may be a symptom of lower
quality products?</p>
<p>By its very nature, a call centre is designed to handle non-standard
calls. Those calls that are outliers. The corner cases. The use cases
used by only a select few and very unlikely users. If it was possible to
answer the questions easily and quickly, chances are it could have been
included as a software change in the next release. If it could be
automated to be handled by a chat-bot, there would be no reason for a
customer to need to phone a call centre in the first place.</p>
<p>Call-centres are intended to deal with corner cases. Their goal
should be to improve the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/09/05/customer-experience-journey/">customer
experience</a> by providing information that is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> available in the system. It is supposed to
be a listening tool to find out what the customers need in order to
deliver better quality products. A barometer to measure the external
environment.</p>
<p><strong><em>By measuring the number of calls handled per day, or the
duration of each call, ultimately you are saying that it is acceptable
to build bad software (or products).</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than compromising the quality by reducing the time spent on
each support call, the goal should be to deliver value (or quality) by
balancing time, cost and scope to meet the sole objective of meeting
customer expectations, which is what quality essentially is about.</p>
<p>It’s not perceived quality when you offer a customer a more expensive
solution with all the bells and whistles that he doesn’t need or want,
just as it isn’t perceived quality when a car salesman offers a Ferrari
because it’s the most expensive option on the floor to someone looking
for cost-effective and family friendly. No one would argue that the
Ferrari is a high-quality vehicle, but it doesn’t meet the needs of the
customer, making it worthless. It is only quality when what you offer
meets the needs and wants of the customer. That is quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quality is not what’s better for you. Quality is what’s better for
the customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improving productivity directly relates to improving quality. Quality
directly relates to the value delivered. High quality, high
productivity.</p>
<p>Re-evaluate whether your measures support higher productivity by
enabling faster delivery of value, or whether it impedes a great user
experience. Just because a customer answers that their call was
sufficiently dealt with by the call centre agent, doesn’t mean that they
are happy with the service or product offering. The only questions that
really matter are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Would you use the service or product again?</em></li>
<li><em>Would you recommend the service or product to someone
else?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than measuring the number of calls handled per day or the time
spent on each call, measure the categories of calls and the number of
similar issues reported. Use it as an input into the design and
development function rather than a fire fighting mechanism to shield the
developers from the errors they made.</p>
<h2 id="youre-doing-too-much">3. You’re doing too much</h2>
<p>More is better. Right?</p>
<p>Well, I would argue that in most cases this is not true at all.
Apple, being the perfect example to prove that it’s not about how much
functionality there is, but how useful that functionality is. Good
design is simple. It’s easy to understand. It doesn’t require you to
read through a manual or attend a training course to use it. It doesn’t
require someone constantly having to show you how to do the same thing
or where to find it.</p>
<p><img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/funficient-quality-triangle.jpg" /></p>
<p>The one axis of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">quality
triangle</a> is scope, yet few productivity improvement suggestions
focus on this aspect. Cost and time improvements are covered in detail,
yet few people realize that scope can be reduced too to improve
productivity. It’s not only about doing more with fewer resources, but
it is also simply about doing less.</p>
<p>One of the deadly <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2018/10/10/why-lean-business-methodologies-can-help-your-business-thrive/">wastes
of lean</a> is overproduction. Producing more functions than what is
used is a waste. It is scientifically proven that the human brain can
only hold 3 – 8 items in working memory. When you open up a program like
Adobe Illustrator with it’s multitude functions, it can be overwhelming
and daunting. Research has also proven that most users only use the same
few functions, with up to 80% of software development unused. Imagine
what you could have done with the time spent on these 80% unused
functions if you weren’t so busy building it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The customer isn’t always right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a difference between blindly saying yes to a customer
request and understanding the need behind this request. Often, you are
serving the customer better by saying no. Many times customers will ask
for a specific function to be built. Yet after finding out why they want
this or how they intend to use it, it often becomes clear that they
either don’t need it, or they want something else than what they asked
for. They just don’t know the technical language you are speaking.
Saying yes to every customer requirement is not adding to the value
delivered and can negatively impact productivity.</p>
<p>Rather than measuring the number of features developed, measure how
users are using it to decide whether something is actually productive or
not.</p>
<h2 id="productivity-improvements-pay-for-itself">Productivity
improvements pay for itself</h2>
<p>More productive teams translate to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2015/04/15/purpose-profit/">higher
profit margin</a>s for the company. Investing in productivity
improvement is an investment, rather than an expense.</p>
<p>To start your journey to more productive teams, make sure you are
measuring the right thing, and that you measure it rights by comparing
apples to apples and including an end-to-end view of the process.
Lastly, learn to say no. Less is more. Discern between what a customer
is asking for and what they actually need to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/05/03/productivity-habits/">achieve
their goal</a>.</p>
<p>Spend more time understanding the need before rushing to build
it.</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">Where does design fit into the development life
cycle?</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

</header>
<p>Every now and again I walk into a new team and more regularly than
not, there seems to be a disconnect between the design- and development
functions.</p>
<p>Understandable.</p>
<p>Rewind 20 years. Design thinking and design was something that
belonged mostly in advertising agencies. The typical software
development team didn’t see the need to include a designer.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and as a product person, sometimes I still feel
like a new toy that no one knows what to do with when walking into a
developer heavy team that’s never worked with designers before.</p>
<p>They know what results they want, but they’re unsure how to
practically integrate it into their existing development process. To
exaggerate the disconnect, the thinking styles of designers compared to
developers are very different. It’s rather like one team talking
Mandarin and the other Spanish.</p>
<p>Crossing this gap between the different thinking styles can be
challenging. Anyone who’s new to Test Driven Development will understand
this, as it requires you to think in a totally different way than what
you’re used to and comfortable with.</p>
<p>When, however, you include a good UX/UI designer or Product Manager,
the results are magical. It’s the difference between Microsoft and Apple
back in the day. The one aimed at being feature-rich and affordable,
while the other aimed at being simple, useful and beautiful, and creates
a niche following that lasts long after the founder’s death and who is
willing to pay a premium to be part of this exclusive club.</p>
<p>Being feature-rich, of course, is not bad in itself. It’s usually
just better to solve a problem (design) and build the <em>right</em>
thing before starting to build, an approach most developers I’ve worked
with prefer.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever found yourself frustrated filtering through all the
junk on the Play Store searching for a useful app, you probably know
what I mean.</p>
<h2 id="is-is-not">Is / Is Not</h2>
<p>So let’s look at a few common misunderstandings when it comes to
design.</p>
<h3 id="design-is-more-than-aesthetics">Design is more than
aesthetics</h3>
<p>Many people tend to think of design as esthetics only. And yes, if
you only include a graphic designer in your team this might be true. But
the Product team is not only there to make something look pretty. In
fact, a Product Manager and UX designer might not be able to draw well
at all.</p>
<p>The design thinking perspective (which is very similar to the Lean
Startup process) is a process that takes a fuzzy goal and turn it into a
tangible prototype (in most cases a mock-up).</p>
<p>In other words, they turn guesses and ideas into educated decisions
based on facts. Their primary focus is to do research and validate ideas
early and cheaply. It is after all much cheaper and faster to change a
design (provided it is broken into small enough parts) than to rebuild
software that didn’t get the desired response from your user base.</p>
<h3 id="good-design-is-good-problem-solving">Good design is good problem
solving</h3>
<p><strong><em>Primarily, the “product” team owns the
problem.</em></strong> They make sure that you’re solving the
<em>right</em> problem — is it useful and is it the most important
priority that will add the most value to the users?</p>
<p>The product team spends time to clarify the problem and come up with
possible solutions which they present to the technical team who will
take over the implementation part.</p>
<p>The double diamond approach below is a tried and tested process to
turn a general problem into a specific problem (prioritize), and then
into a possible solution that is validated with the users before it is
handed over to the development team to build.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*dIU3kC94kFC7CyOU.png" /></p>
<p>Image from <a href="https://www.gdm.gent/design-meets-research/hcd/"
class="uri">https://www.gdm.gent/design-meets-research/hcd/</a></p>
<p>The “development” team, on the other hand, primarily owns the
<em>solution —</em> the <em>how</em> it’s done. They make sure that the
problem is robust, safe, efficient, and maintainable. They take the
prototype (usually a mock-up or concept) from the product team and
figure out how best to build it.</p>
<p>Comparing it to building a house, the architect and interior designer
would be the “product team”, while the engineers, builders, plumbers,
and everyone else required to transform the idea on a piece of paper
into something tangible, is the “development team”.</p>
<h3 id="to-design-sprint-or-not-to-design-sprint">To design sprint or
not to design sprint</h3>
<p>Google made <a
href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint">Design
Sprints</a> popular and with that opened the door to include a design
team into the process of development. Design Sprints — the Google way —
is, however, most suitable for startups or products looking for new
ideas. Most teams don’t need it. Or at least not in the focused, 5 day
format.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*aeZo9TyhgPBQeR9VZl9_8w.png" /></p>
<p>Image from <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint"
class="uri">https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint</a></p>
<p>A design iteration — the non-Google way — can take many forms. What
is most important is to include all the stakeholders early on. The
reasons being:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To ensure you’re meeting the customer’s expectations and goals,
and;</li>
<li>To design something that can technically be built by the team
responsible for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>That doesn’t mean, however, that everyone should do everything
together. It could very well mean a number of workshops where everyone
does everything together. But in reality, this is rarely useful for an
existing product.</p>
<p><strong><em>The purpose of the design sprint is to prepare the
requirements adequately so that the developers can spend their effort in
figuring out</em> how<em>, not what to build.</em></strong> This means
ensuring it is needed, useful, and the most important thing right now.
It also means that any unknowns will be identified and turned into knows
before the developers have to start building.</p>
<h3 id="mindset-matters">Mindset matters</h3>
<p>More and more developers are starting to see the benefit of including
a good Product Manager (not to be confused with a <em>Project</em>
Manager who only owns the process, not the product) in a software
development team.</p>
<p>Yet, many developers simply don’t see <em>why</em> they need a
Product Manager (or Product Owner or UX designer…) if they can find
ready made assets online and use libraries to build forms, pages,
etc.</p>
<p>It’s hard (or maybe impossible), however, to see the forest from the
trees. It’s much more efficient to have someone look at the forest from
afar while another is amidst the trees trying to navigate their way
between complex code.</p>
<p>The mindset required to think about a user experience compared to
building a rather complex piece of software is completely different. The
one requires an external, objective viewpoint — like observing at
something from the outside. — while the other requires a more subjective
viewpoint — like examining something from within.</p>
<h3 id="are-you-building-the-right-thing">Are you building the right
thing?</h3>
<p>Another, more pressing reason is that as much as 80% of software
isn’t used by users. When presented with a cluttered and feature rich
interface users will probably focus on the 20% features they are already
familiar with.</p>
<p><strong><em>That means a substantial chunk of your development effort
goes towards unused software.</em></strong> Maybe because they can’t
find it, or more probably because it doesn’t help the end-users’ achieve
their goals more effectively.</p>
<p><em>That’s a lot of waste!</em></p>
<p>Including “product” (a collective word I use to refer to everyone
involved in the design process, including a Product Manager, a UX
designer, a graphic designer and possibly a Business Analyst or Product
Owner) perspective increases the probability that what you’re building
is useful and adds value to the user. It’s thus usually a lot more
productive.</p>
<h2 id="a-recipe-for-an-integrated-development-process">A recipe for an
integrated development process</h2>
<p>So now that we know why design is important, let’s look at how to
practically include it in the process and where the boundaries are.</p>
<h3 id="customer-brief-discovery">1. Customer brief | Discovery</h3>
<p>The first point of contact is usually a result of a pain point or a
desire to create something innovative. The customer will brief the
product team (and possibly a technical lead) or end-users will complain
about something they feel is important to them.</p>
<p>I find including the technical team in the process at this early
stage is less useful than helpful as everything will most probably
change from brief to planned sprint or iteration. I would much rather
record the session and make it available to the technical team as
optional viewing should they be interested in it than including them in
the brief in-person.</p>
<p>At this early stage, the primary purpose of the product manager /
product owner is to determine what success might look like for the
customer. <em>What does the customer want the users to do and how will
they feel when the pain point is resolved? What will be different? What
will it look like when the problem isn’t there anymore?</em></p>
<h3 id="research-reality">2. Research | Reality</h3>
<p>Once you understand the desired outcome, the next step is typically
to spend time researching what is already in place, what others are
doing, and what end-users need, starting with the process flows of what
they currently do.</p>
<p>Roads are made by walking. The best designed software support
worklows and real-life processes. Start with mapping out the processes,
for example:</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*nukiarZzgiKg3L5h4ryaDw.png" /></p>
<p>Simple process flow in Conceptboard</p>
<p>It is also useful to have a mood board with some inspiration as below
with some sample timers for a timer app:</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*t5y3cvUL-Cwxn4NNumwdVA.png" /></p>
<p>High level product scope with a mood board to serve as
inspiration.</p>
<p>A competitor analysis to identify what’s missing is also useful at
this early stage, for example comparing what aspects of a competitor you
love, and what you wish were there that currently isn’t:</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1322/1*f3-oVdgZ7ThmSvv6VgoW6w.png" /></p>
<p>Simple competitor evaluation to identify what’s missing.</p>
<p>I like to use <strong><a
href="http://conceptboard.com/">Conceptboard</a></strong> for this phase
as it’s specifically designed for this and has an infinite canvas that
grows with your product.</p>
<p>Once the foundation is laid and you know what is needed, the next
step is to design a rough concept. This is not intended to be a
pixel-perfect design, but rather a tangible artifact to enable a useful
discussion and the ability to make changes fast, and collaboratively.
The goal is to visually communicate rather than finalize a design, thus
I usually don’t spend more than a few hours on this.</p>
<p>In many cases this is enough to allow the developers to start
building, leaving enough room for them to add their contributions.
However, in a new product design the next step would be to create more
detailed designs and workflows.</p>
<p>After reviewing it with the technical team and getting their input,
present the key research insights and high-level concept to the customer
for discussion.</p>
<p>The goal at this stage is to get feedback, not approval.</p>
<h3 id="planning-and-design-iterative-approach">3. Planning and design |
Iterative approach</h3>
<p>Once the customer and technical team feels confident that the
solution is adequate and realistic, a few things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product manager breaks down the concept into smaller chunks
which will become individual user stories that can deliver a complete
valuable feature at the end of a maximum one week iteration.</li>
<li>The graphic designer finalizes the designs and identify or update
design system components.</li>
<li>The technical team negotiates with the Product Manager to find a
balance between scope and time, following the <strong><a

approach to shape work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than the technical team saying how much time it will take to
do something as in traditional Scrum, the Product Manager dictates how
much appetite they have for a specific feature and then negotiate the
contents to fit into this budget. Thus, estimations are product-driven
rather than developer-driven.</p>
<p>Again I like to use Conceptboard for planning as it is extremely
flexible to create a layout showing the planned iterations and status of
each smaller chunk of work in one view. For design I prefer
<strong>Figma</strong> but any tool that is accessible by the whole team
and easy to navigate is acceptable and depends on the graphic designer’s
preferences.</p>
<h3 id="building-development">4. Building | Development</h3>
<p>The next step is to hand over the first iteration to the developers,
who will effectively work in a black box, unless something pops up that
require input from the Product Owner, similar to what Scrum was designed
for.</p>
<p>The Product Manager has no say as to how the developers build the
artifact that was handed over to them. They rely on feedback from the
developers to know if there’s an issue in a push rather than pull
approach, limiting interruptions to the developers as much as
possible.</p>
<p>They will typically start working on the next concept while the
developers are building.</p>
<p>At the end of the iteration, the developers demo what they’ve done in
a production like environment where the Product Manager can interact
with the product and ask questions similar to the Scrum review
meeting.</p>
<h3 id="validate-approve">5. Validate | Approve</h3>
<p>At the end of the iteration and after the demo, the Product Manager
or product team validates it. The validation process aims to ensure that
the right product was built and that it integrates without any
unexpected error into the larger system before handing it over to the
customer for final validation before it is deployed into production.</p>
<p>Once an iteration is approved, a retrospective looks back at the past
iteration to see if there’s anything that can be improved for the next
one before continuing with the next iteration.</p>
<h2 id="bridging-the-gap">Bridging the gap</h2>
<p>Scrum changed the world. But it is a process framework for developers
and most problems I see are not building the <em>thing</em> right (aka
development), but building the <em>right</em> thing (aka design).</p>
<p>Being productive is not just about ensuring that you are optimizing
the way you do things. The most important aspect of productivity is to
start with a clear goal. This is where design fit into the process.</p>
<p>So next time you’re struggling to prioritize, or frustrated with
ever-changing requirements, consider <em>starting</em> with the end in
mind.</p>

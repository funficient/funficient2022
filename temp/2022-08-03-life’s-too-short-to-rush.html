<h2 id="how-to-make-a-trip-truly-memorable">How to make a trip truly
memorable</h2>
<p>We’re three strangers who just met, sitting on a rooftop bar and
casually engaging in conversation as we’re sipping a beer watching the
sun set from atop. We’re talking about hopes and dreams of the future to
come and how we are planning to change the world.</p>
<p><em>“Life’s too short to rush.”</em> the words flow out unexpectedly
as this goddess of fire talks about meeting the love of her life and
spending a day with him doing absolutely nothing. The wisdom strikes a
chord within as I don’t know what she means yet I understand
exactly.</p>
<h2 id="first-you-understand-then-you-know">First You Understand, Then
You Know</h2>
<p>There’s a difference between knowing and understanding. Knowing is
when your logical mind can interpret the information. Understanding,
however, is when your heart and body knows but you’re not able to
articulate it into words or explain it logically. It feels like relief.
A wave of relaxation streaming through your body as you receive an
answer to a question you’ve been pondering for a while. Knowing, on the
other hand, feels more like confirmation, re-iterating something you
already know.</p>
<h2 id="too-busy-to-live">Too Busy To Live?</h2>
<p>For anyone that has been lucky enough to go on a game drive in
Africa, you’ll know that when you drive fast you are very likely to miss
the majestic elephant hiding in the shadows of the trees or the leopard
patiently observing from a tree. It takes slowing down to get most of a
game drive. It’s not about covering more ground but getting the most of
the ground you do cover.</p>
<p>Life is exactly the same. It’s not about how fast you go or how much
you’ve done, it’s about how engaged you are in what you do. It’s the
difference between rushing through Paris on a Contiki tour, taking
pictures from inside the bus as you’re driving past the Eiffel Tower, or
sitting for hours on the same spot in a coffee shop observing the people
around you as you slowly sip on a coffee and watch the patterns
emerge.</p>
<h2 id="local-is-lekker">Local Is Lekker</h2>
<p>A trip becomes truly memorable and worthwhile when you allow yourself
to participate in the local culture. When you slow down and take the
time to fully engage in what you are doing rather to see how much you
can do in the shortest available time.</p>
<p>The best travel experiences of my life has been slow.</p>
<p>It is sharing food with locals in hidden places far away from the
busy and overcrowded main streets. It’s being taken to a small Italian
restaurant outside the touristy center of Brussels where there’s place
for six people and you know that each meal is prepared with care and
love.</p>
<p>It’s allowing the local Thai to take you to a roadside stall and
ordering food on your behalf, being pleasantly surprised to discover the
true flavors of the region which you would never have experienced did
you order yourself.</p>
<p>It’s being invited to share a home cooked meal with new-made Chinese
friends, educating me in the cultural habits and introducing me to new
flavors and ways of eating. It’s playing games after dinner and washing
the dishes together when you truly experience the culture of the country
you’re visiting. You don’t experience culture by staying in a hotel and
doing planned tours.</p>
<h2 id="travel-is-a-cultural-exploration">Travel is a Cultural
Exploration</h2>
<p>Culture is only experienced when you engage in conversation with the
locals, eat together and smell the surrounds. In France it smells like
perfume and flowers as you walk through the streets and the markets. In
Thailand it smells like animals being slaughtered as you walk through
carcasses hanging around and all sorts of animal pieces lying around. In
Africa it smells like sweat and dirt. In Europe it smells mouldy and old
as you walk into the ancient shops and restaurants. It’s not about it
smelling good or bad, it’s about smelling the uniqueness of the place
you are in. It’s about tasting the flavors of the food and appreciating
the colors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you go fast, you end up having been everywhere but not having
experienced much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is whether you want to be the tortoise of the hare? The
hare goes fast but ends up losing the race while the tortoise slowly but
purposefully moves towards his destination.</p>
<p>I again realize the importance of going slow as I walk into a
courtyard asking someone who works there where I can find the vineyard.
She looks at me blankly and responds that there is no vineyard. I
continue looking, find the nearly 250 year old vineyard and touch the
bottles of wine that is still being produced from the grapes from the
vine. I walk back to the girl, show her the plant barely 100m away from
where she spends most of her day. Right behind her I read about the
history of this oldest vine in Cape Town, possibly the entire Africa, on
a huge poster which she has never noticed before.</p>
<p>To travel you don’t have to leave your own city or country. To travel
you need to slow down enough so that you can notice the nuances in the
cultures around you. It’s about taking the time to walk into a shop
where you’ve never been before. It’s about doing something you’ve never
done before. It’s about talking to someone you’ve never met before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life becomes fun when you take the time to enjoy it. Life is about
the exploration. It’s about finding as many treasures as possible on
your way, not reaching a destination.</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="tools-to-evaluate-the-true-culture">Tools to evaluate the true
culture</h2>
<p><em>Culture is the driving force of the behaviors of an organization.
Healthy culture, happy people, quality products. Dysfunctional culture,
unhappy people, error-filled products.</em></p>
<p>Culture however is not easy to see from the outside. Often you have
to rely on what is written down on paper or the brief interaction during
the recruitment process to serve as your guide deciding whether the
organization is a cultural fit for you or not.</p>
<p>Mostly, and sadly, many people rely on the employer to decide whether
you will be a cultural fit for <em>them</em>, neglecting their own
needs. But you know yourself much better than any recruiter ever will,
and cultural fit is as important for the employee as for the
employer.</p>
<p>It is thus important for the potential new colleague to take cultural
fit into their own hands rather than be disappointed after the honeymoon
period of a new job has worn off.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-evaluate-the-agility-of-a-company">How to evaluate the
agility of a company</h1>
<p>There are just too many companies out there claiming to be agile when
they merely adopted a scrum board. One of the worst things for a true
agilist is joining a so-called agile company just to find out that there
is very little agile about it. Once agile, it’s hard to go back to
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>So how do you tell if a company is <em>really</em> agile or just
saying they are to the outside world?</p>
<p>From personal failures and successes in past job searches, below are
some things to look out for and explained by comparing it to the
organizational development model by Frederic Laloux in his book called
<a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/">Reinventing
Organizations</a>.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*aSBKQ8AnakbzUxW4Sn-Bsg.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Image from Reinventing Organizations <a
href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/powerpoints.html">resources</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, for those not familiar with the model, the organization’s
maturity is mapped against the colors of a rainbow, starting at the
lowest frequency color of red, moving to the higher frequency of green,
teal and beyond. The closer an organization is to teal, the more agile
and less bureaucratic an organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An agile organization is Teal, but Teal is more than
agile.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most large corporates today operate mainly from an amber-conformist
or orange-achievement culture, where bureaucracy, rules and procedures
dominate and a strong hierarchy of power exists. Green-pluralistic is
typically all the non-profits, operating from a value-perspective and
honoring the individual with Teal-evolutionary running the organization
based on trust, implementing self-management practices and evolutionary
development processes and support.</p>
<p>As the relationship between the organization and the new employee is
driven by the heart of the organization, namely Human Resources, it
makes sense to dig deeper into the recruitment process as a reflection
of the heart of the company as a whole.</p>
<p>Below are some pitfalls and red flags to look for in your job search
if you’re in search of a truly agile organization.</p>
<h2 id="the-job-description">The job description</h2>
<p>A job description is the first point of interaction you might
possibly have with a future employer. It is a necessary evil as it
specifies the need that the company currently has. It is also an easy
way to spot the agility and operational model of the organization as a
whole.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to look out for to help you rate the agility of
a company.</p>
<p><em>Take into consideration that an organization is more complex than
a few interactions or processes, and it is possible that there might be
more agile teams behind a non-agile HR department. It also depends on
your personal level of agility and what you are looking for in an
organization.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>How did you first hear about the job
opening?</em></strong></p>
<p>If the job description is posted on a generic job board like Monster,
chances are you are dealing with an amber or orange organization, where
standard procedures are followed.</p>
<p>A Teal organization will be the one <em>proactively</em> looking for
talent, not waiting for someone to come knocking on their door in
<em>response</em> to a broadcast message to the world.</p>
<p><em>They value culture more than anything else, and is very picky
with who they allow into their inner circle. They’ll keep an eye on you,
evaluating your fit for culture and purpose by your interactions with
the world, not the words you put on a piece of paper.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Do they make use an agency for
outsourcing?</em></strong></p>
<p>If they make use of a recruitment agency — run as fast as you can.
The more agile, the more integrated the functions of the organizations.
Outsourcing such a crucial part of your business might be a red flag,
indicating a culture where management are too busy to be bothered with
the <em>people</em> issues.</p>
<p><strong><em>How automated is the application
process?</em></strong></p>
<p>When the recruitment process is automated and you’re asked to
complete all your personal information that is already in your resume
into a job engine according to their format, it’s a warning sign of an
organization operating mainly from an orange paradigm.</p>
<p>An organization operating from an orange paradigm runs a business
like a machine, where each person is seen as a replaceable resource that
needs to be told what to do.</p>
<p>It also indicates that you might need to change in order to fit in
with <em>their</em> culture, rather than embracing individuality,
showing a level of inflexibility.</p>
<p><strong><em>What does the job description look
like?</em></strong></p>
<p>How long is the job description? How unique is the contents? How much
emphasis is placed on personal values and skills rather than technical
abilities?</p>
<p>Look out for generic job descriptions or anything more than one page.
Those 5 page job descriptions that look as if they’ve been copied and
pasted from a template because they look exactly the same as about a
thousand other job descriptions, just with another company name attached
to it.</p>
<p>An agile culture values people and individuality more than processes
and tools.</p>
<p>They are looking to find someone to <em>complement</em> an existing,
unique team of people, not merely <em>replacing</em> a cog in the wheel
as would be the case in an orange organization.</p>
<p>An agile job description is short, gives responsibilities rather than
detailed tasks and interactions, and focus on behaviors <em>and</em>
skills.</p>
<p><strong><em>How long does it take to get a
response?</em></strong></p>
<p>The longer it takes to get a response on an inquiry or application,
the more likely that the organization is driven by bureaucracy.</p>
<p>An agile company won’t wait to act when they find someone they would
like to engage with. Responding promptly indicates that they value you
as a person as well as your time. It shows that they don’t deem
themselves as more important as you.</p>
<p><strong><em>What does the recruitment process look
like?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are a number of things to look for, but in essence, the
flexibility and the level of involvement of the team are indicators of
agility.</p>
<p>A long recruitment process only involving <em>talking</em> to HR and
the managers, like a bad sales pitch, indicates an organization is
possibly operating from an orange paradigm.</p>
<p>An agile organization will be flexible to your needs as well as
theirs. They’ll meet you halfway.</p>
<p>They will involve the team you are to join in the recruitment
process, understanding that it is ultimately the team’s decision, not
the manager’s whether you’re a good fit or not. When you don’t meet the
team at all, it’s a clear warning sign that the team’s voice is not as
important as it should be.</p>
<p>An agile organization will allow you to join a team meeting, which I
would highly recommend, as meetings are the true teller of any
culture.</p>
<p>Is the team looking forward to get together? Are they reporting to
each other, rather than to the manager? Do they leave energized? How
long is the meeting?</p>
<p><strong><em>How do they treat outsiders?</em></strong></p>
<p>Are they open to outsiders, arranging public get-togethers where
people can see what the company is like? Do they respond on social
media? Do they even have a public social media profile where people can
reach out to them?</p>
<p>An agile company has at it’s foundation respect for people, treating
each person as important — whether you are the cleaner or the CEO. This
respect is best evaluated when they don’t know who you are. Try to
interact with them on social media or at a public meetup and see how the
react and respond.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Culture is the number one source of happiness or unhappiness in an
organization. It is each person’s responsibility to make sure that they
are a cultural fit before they engage with a new organization or
team.</p>
<p><em>Human resources, as the heart of an organization, is the driver
of culture within an organization. The recruitment process and
interaction with Human Resources will be a very accurate tool to
evaluate the true culture of an organization, not relying only on what
they tell you.</em></p>

stories? Please share your thoughts on the subject in the
comments.</em></p>

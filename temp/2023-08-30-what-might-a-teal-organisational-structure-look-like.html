    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">What might a teal organisational structure look
like?</h1>

<p>The majority of organisations today operate primarily from an orange
paradigm. They follow the rules and structures invented during the
industrial revolution. A handful of organisations have, however,
transitioned towards the more evolved <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">teal
paradigm</a> according to <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-09-01-reinventing-organizations/">Frederic
Laloux’s</a> organisational development model.  This post takes a
high-level look at the difference between predominantly orange and teal
operating models relating to organisational structure.  It also outlines
a possible map to help you transition from orange to teal.</p>
<p>The organisational structure is arguably the most important aspect of
an organisation. No matter how agile your individual teams are, without
a supportive structure, you will never be as <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">“teal”</a>
or <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/10/28/ownership/">agile</a>
as you hope to be.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-an-orange-hierarchical-pyramid-structure">Characteristics
of an ‘orange’ hierarchical pyramid structure</h2>
<p>A predominantly orange organisation has a typical hierarchical
pyramid structure most people are familiar with. A main decision-maker
(CEO) is typically at the top of the pyramid. In a division-of-work
model, each layer in the hierarchy divides the responsibilities in a
waterfall-like structure. Information typically flows downward in a one
directional stream.  There is little to no <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/11/29/feedback/">feedback</a>
loop back up, thus the term waterfall.</p>
<figure>
<img

alt="A typical hierarchical pyramid as main structure for orange organizations" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A typical hierarchical pyramid as main
structure for orange organizations</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typically, the people on the floor have little decision-making power.
They serve as metaphorical ‘<em>spokes in the wheel</em>’ of a much
bigger <em>machine</em> - machine being the describing metaphor for a
typical ‘orange’ organization. The top decision-makers decide the why,
the what, and the how while the people on the ground follow these
instructions without question.</p>
<p>A predominantly ‘orange’ organisation usually have a lot of layers
within the hierarchy.  Typically they consist of team leads, managers,
group managers, directors, group directors, and executives.  The higher
you are in the hierarchy the more decision-making power you have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Did you know that the first organisational
structure was developed in 1854 and has remained mainly unchanged to
this day?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottom layer of the pyramid operates on the tactical level while
the top layers typically monitor the status of work by means of status
reports and numbers. Often they don’t have direct contact with the
bottom-layer workers, relying on written reports via a middleman. 
Mostly, the CEO addresses the organisation as a whole only a few times a
year with limited interaction.</p>
<p>Information in this waterfall-like structure flows down in a
need-to-know manner. The public usually is not privy to information like
roadmaps, financial performance, internal processes etc.</p>
<p>The goal at the heart of this hierarchical structure is short-term
profit.  Yearly profits are the primary indicator of success. Decisions
are driven by looking at the numbers.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-a-teal-self-organising-team-structure">Characteristics
of a ‘teal’ self-organising team structure</h2>
<p>A predominantly ‘teal’ organisation has a number of self-organising
teams. The structure is fluid and changes as the projects within the
organisation change. Typically there are either no titles, everyone
being a “partner” or “associate” with different roles and
responsibilities.  Whether there are titles or not, though, the key
difference between orange and teal structures is the lack of
hierarchy.</p>
<p>Each self-organising team consists of a fully cross-functional team,
meaning all the different functions like finance, risk, safety etc. have
representatives within the team. The organisation effectively consists
of a number of startups with a strategic team mainly responsible for the
coordination of the bigger organisation.</p>
<h3 id="the-octopus-model">The octopus model</h3>
<p>This model can be compared to an octopus. The head is the part
responsible for coordination, while each different leg has full
decision-making power and is autonomous in its operation. There needs to
be agreement within all different parts for it to function effectively. 
Each leg has a different perspective on a topic, adding information to
give a more complete picture of any situation.</p>
<h3 id="the-circular-economy">The circular economy</h3>
<p>The design of the organisational structure is typically circular
rather than the pyramid, reflecting a <a
href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/circular-economy/">circular
economy</a>, or whole system, within itself. Systems thinking is at the
heart of anorganization operating from a teal paradigm. The primary goal
is to minimise inputs and waste in a generative way. The value chain
takes into consideration the impact of waste on the environment and any
changes in the outside climate. Whenever the climate changes, the
structure adapts to either add or repurpose teams to ensure
sustainability.</p>

alt="A typical teal circular economy organizational structure" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A typical teal circular economy
organizational structure</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="a-fully-connected-system">A fully connected system</h3>
<p>Decision-making power never lies with only one person in an
organization operating from a teal paradigm. A key characteristic of
this structure is that it’s connected to all parts of the system. Where
in an ‘orange’ organisation there is no direct contact between the CEO
and the people on the ground, for example, in a teal organisation
everyone is connected in some way. Some connections might be weaker than
others, but there are clear connections between all parts.</p>
<p>Typically teams consist of 8 – 10 people and a specific
organisational unit never has more than 120 – 150 people. Some people
experience the optimal size as low as 40. When a unit grows to more than
150 people a new unit with a specific purpose is defined.  If you’re
interested to find out more about these magical numbers, I highly
recommend reading <a
href="https://www.blog.funficient.com/blog/2022-12-16-the-tipping-point/">The
Tipping Point</a> by Malcolm Gladwell.</p>
<p>The heart of the organisation is contributing to the world with a
meaningful purpose. Profit is the result of success rather than the
primary goal.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>Knowing what the goal is, here is a rough guide to help you get from
an orange structure to a more teal organisational structure.</p>
<h3 id="know-where-you-are">1. Know where you are</h3>
<p>In order to get where you want to be, it is necessary to admit to
where you are.  Many organisations tend to be positively optimistic
about where they are, unwilling to admit to reality. In order to change,
though, you have to be willing to admit where you are.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-one-cross-functional-team-on-a-low-risk-project">2.
Start with one cross-functional team on a low-risk project</h3>
<p>One key principle supporting organisations operating from a teal
paradigm is that they grow organically.  Identify a low-risk project
where going through the growing pains and experimenting with what works
for your unique organisation to serve as starting point.  Identify and
include a fully cross-functional team for this project in a mini-startup
way with a clearly defined purpose and outcome.</p>
<h3 id="add-teams-organically">3. Add teams organically</h3>
<p>Following the Fibonacci sequence, start adding similarly structured
teams.  First add only one cross-functional team, clearly defining the
boundaries and connections between these two teams in addition to the
unique purpose and outcome. Then, add two more teams in a similar way,
then four, etc.</p>
<h3 id="repurpose-middle-management">4. Repurpose middle management</h3>
<p>A fundamental difference between a predominant orange and teal
organisation is that in self-organising and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/09/18/autonomous-teams/">autonomous</a>
teams there’s no need for management. Similar to how Artificial
Intelligence requires that job requirements changes, so too moving
towards operating from a teal paradigm requires the role of management
to adapt.</p>
<p>Help the managers to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/06/09/teal-hiring/">find
a suitable role</a>within the new structure that best suits their skills
and is something they want. If a manager sees the process as a demotion,
they are probably not ready to transition to teal.  It will feel like
the natural next step when the organisation is ready for the transition,
not like loss or forced adaptation.</p>
<p>This could typically look like becoming a specialist in an area or
choosing to become an advisor or coach.</p>
<p>There is still a <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/25/teal-leadership/">need
for leadership</a> within a teal organisation. Managers could also
become mentors to others to help them develop their leadership skills
and thus increase the level of autonomy in the organization.  The core
difference is that the management responsibilities are rotated within a
team.  For example, there is not one Scrum Master with the function of
facilitating agile rituals, in each sprint or iteration the team selects
someone who will perform the role of the Scrum Master, or distribute the
responsibilities among the different team members.</p>
<h3 id="define-the-organisational-structure">5. Define the
organisational structure</h3>
<p>Just like the anatomy of a human body helps us understand where a
problem lies when diagnosing a disease, so too having a map of the
interconnections within an organisation greatly improves efficiency. 
Creating a visual representation of an organisation helps align
everyone.</p>
<p>Define a structure showing the boundaries and connections but without
the names of people.  Define the different business units with their
core purpose and relationships to other units.  You can then, as a
second layer (as an example) add the names of the people associated with
the unit.</p>
<p>The key is that the structure should support fluidity and regular
changes.  Specific people don’t define a business unit, roles do.  The
names of the people should be expected to change regularly.</p>
<h3 id="rotate-roles">6. Rotate roles</h3>
<p>Finally, before the start of each iteration, determine who will
rotate to a different team and who will remain. Factors that might be
considered in this decision include continuity, personal development,
redundancy, and time off.</p>
<p>For example, it is useful to have a key person remain in the team to
ensure stability and minimise handover time.  On the other hand,
developing people and creating a more sustainable team by rotating
people to different projects and teams will greatly satisfy the need for
challenge and learning.  It also means that if one person, for any
reason, leaves the team, there is always a backup who can take over at
short notice. As a bonus, anyone can take leave at any time without any
major impact on existing projects.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The structures we know, including organisational structures, are due
for a rework.  Invented more than 100 years ago and mostly unchanged, it
is time to more critically look at the future of work and what it
practically looks like.</p>
<p>The most fundamental change to support organisational growth from a
predominantly orange paradigm to teal requires a more fluid, circular
structure.  A ‘teal’ organisational structure supports an ever-changing
environment and a closer relationship with the customers and the
environment.  To be efficient it requires self-organising and autonomous
teams, or what is most commonly known as distributed leadership or
boss-less organisations.</p>
<p>It’s been proven that this model of leadership works surprisingly
well with more and more success stories and case studies becoming
available.  So the question is no longer whether it’s possible.</p>
<p>The question is – are you ready for growth?</p>

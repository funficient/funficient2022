<p><em>How to practice an agile mindset in everyday life.</em></p>
<p>You don’t have to develop software to develop an agile mindset. You
also don’t have to enroll in an expensive course to develop agility in
your thinking. And you don’t necessarily have to follow Scrum if you
want to be agile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the most agile organizations started off using Scrum, but
stopped following any defined methodology, as agility is about
responding to change over following a plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyday agile is about practices and tools to be agile each and
every day, regardless of the methodology, technology, or environment.
And one of my goals is to integrate agile and lean into non-development
environments, making it more than just another software development
methodology.</p>
<p>Naturally, this lead me to find ways to integrate agile into areas
where no technology, or very little technology, exists. I worked with
beauty spas, physiotherapy centers, with a gynecologist, a primary
school, a print design company, a travel agent, retailers, and the past
few weeks, learning how to make soap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal is to find ways to make agile accessible to everyone, much
like Apple made personal computers accessible to the masses, not only
developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some of my insights on how to apply agile in everyday life,
from learning how to make soap.</p>
<h2 id="rules-are-there-to-be-broken.">1. Rules are there to be
broken.</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I had no idea how soap is made, and if you told me I
would become a soap-maker hobbyist, I would have laughed at you. But a
few batches of soap later, and I’m in love!</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RsmsnvgVfCOjTh69s14mrA.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Creativity flows when you break the rules.</p>
<p>The love affair, however, only started when I started breaking the
rules. With the first two batches I was too scared and followed the
recipes blindly, resulting in a boring (but beautiful) bar of soap.</p>
<p>As my confidence grew though, I started experimenting. I replaced
olive oil (which ran out) with macadamia oil, water with a cup of green
rooibos tea, and added organic ingredients, which changes the
saponification rate and amount of lye required.</p>
<p><em>My creativity started to flow</em> with each new batch, and every
one is getting better, more exciting, more interesting. My love affair
is blooming more and more every day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world of software development is no different, with creativity
and motivated employees at the heart of a successful, and agile,
organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s face it — there is more competition for any given technical
solution than what you can keep up with. What differentiates you is no
longer the technical solution itself, but the technical solution
<em>and</em> the customer relationships, or the technical solution
<em>and</em> the level of innovation around it. <em>You need creativity
to stand out from the crowds.</em></p>
<p>An agile organization doesn’t follow rules blindly, and rules are not
enforced either. Rules are available as a safety net, like training
wheels when learning to ride a bicycle. But that’s their purpose — to
provide a safe environment while mastering a new skill, and to ensure
order in a complex society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agile organization understands that breaking the rules also leads
to breakthroughs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking rules <em>thoughtfully</em> and with adequate knowledge to
make an informed decision, can help an organization or team overcome
obstacles during the sprint, or design an innovative solution.</p>
<h2 id="know-the-rules-before-you-start-breaking-them.">2. Know the
rules before you start breaking them.</h2>
<p>But before you can start breaking the rules, you first need to know
them. An agile organization is not anarchy, hoping to deliver at the end
of the sprint.</p>
<p>Agile teams are confident that they can deliver the stories committed
to, and they know that they can only be confident if they have the
necessary proof from past experience.</p>
<p>With soap making, you first need to understand the science, or rules,
of the reaction, and how each ingredient will influence the soap making
process.</p>
<p>Each oil has different properties, and depending on these properties,
the soap will be less bubbly, more conditioning, or contains too much or
too little iodine. Each oil also has a different SAP value, which tells
you how much sodium hydroxide is needed, and for the soap to form, you
need to have exactly the correct amount of sodium hydroxide for the
reaction to take place.</p>
<p>You have to follow the rules, and understand how breaking them will
change the outcome of your results. In any organization, breaking rules
have an impact, so it is necessary to understand the impact of change
before the change happens.</p>
<h2 id="constraints-are-fuel-for-innovation">3. Constraints are fuel for
innovation</h2>
<p>Whenever a constraint during the sprint is used as an excuse not to
deliver, you can be sure that it is not an agile team. Agile teams
welcome obstacles and are not stopped from delivering as a result of
constraints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obstacles and constraints are the best tools to cultivate an agile
mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An agile team views obstacles as opportunities to try something new,
to push limits, and most importantly, to learn.</p>
<p>When I started making soap, I didn’t want to waste expensive oils not
being sure whether the recipe will work or not. I decided to start with
a smaller batch, but this presented a new problem.</p>
<p>The molds I had was too large for the mixture, rendering them
useless. The solution I came up with turned out to be so good that I am
still using that rather than the original molds. As apposed to having to
make a large batch of soap, not knowing whether people will like it or
not, I now use old milk bottles which not only makes it much easier, but
I’m also more flexible. I can try out different recipes and test them
out before producing in bulk. Smaller is better. Always.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The constraint turned out to be a blessing. View it as an
opportunity, not an obstacle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only difference between the two is your perspective. If you’re an
optimist, it’s an opportunity. For pessimists, it’s a problem. <em>Which
would you rather deal with?</em></p>
<h2 id="respect-your-fear">4. Respect your fear</h2>
<p>I was surprised at how afraid I was to make my first batch of soap.
I’ve jumped off a mountain paragliding, I’ve ski-dived, I’ve scuba dived
to sub 40m on air and were nearly swallowed by a whale shark.</p>
<p>Yet, I was afraid of mixing sodium hydroxide with water!</p>
<p>Soap making requires safety goggles, protective gloves and good
ventilation, as the chemical reaction between the sodium hydroxide and
water is dangerous, emitting a poisonous gas as part of the chemical
reaction. This is what stops a lot of people from making cold pressed
soap.</p>
<p>This fear of the unknown made me realize the importance of this
emotion, whether when making soap, or trying something new when
developing software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Fear is designed to keep you safe. Respect it, but don’t be a
slave to it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growth only happens when you push yourself outside your comfort
zones. Naturally, that means that you’ll be faced with fear. The
difference between an agile and non-agile organization, is their
reaction to this fear of the unknown. An agile organization doesn’t
allow fear to stop them from changing, they respond to the change
regardless of their fear of failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of fear is to warn you of danger in order to keep you
safe, not to stop you from doing what you fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When fear faces you, don’t run away, rather look at it carefully and
continue with focused attention.</p>
<h2 id="theres-no-such-thing-as-a-mistake">5. There’s no such thing as a
mistake</h2>
<p>A lot of ground breaking inventions, including our much loved post-it
notes, were considered to be “mistakes”. The glue on post-it notes was a
failed attempt because it was supposed to stick, and it didn’t.</p>
<p>If they threw away the invention, discarding it as a mistake, we
would not be able to effortlessly and easily visualize information, and
change our minds without having to re-do the work. An agile organization
allows for mistakes, and learns from it. They don’t discard results that
didn’t meet expectations as faults, rather as feedback to allow them to
improve.</p>
<p>Part of my soap making involves extracting the juice from a succulent
and once, I accidentally broke the narrow, or “wrong”, end of the leaf.
This mistake turned out to be an easier way to extract more juice from
the leaf. If I didn’t make the mistake, I would never have discovered
the easy way to do it.</p>
<p>An agile organization is at it’s heart a learning organization, and
that means a lot of failures. In a non-agile organization, management
views mistakes as that — something that should be avoided, something
that is wrong, unwanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agile organization, on the other hand, views a mistake as an
opportunity for learning and growth, possibly even a ground breaking
invention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An agile organization allows teams and people to make mistakes, and
they don’t discard mistakes without first critically evaluating how it
can improve the process.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Training your mind to become agile, is training it to be more
flexible. Similarly, an agile organization is a flexible organization.
An organization that has rules, but allows for these rules to change
dynamically. An organization that values learning and growth more than
playing it safe. An organization that courageously acts and responds
even when faced with fear.</p>
<p>And all of that, I learned from making soap…</p>

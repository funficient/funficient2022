<h1 class="title">What is psychological safety?</h1>

<p>Safety is the foundational prerequisite to any high performing team.
When there is adequate psychological safety in the workplace employee
wellness will increase and as a result turnover will reduce. Also,
creativity and innovation will drastically increase and with that, the
overall productivity and potentially profitability will increase. Most
importantly, though, is that you will attract and retain top talent.</p>
<p>Few workplaces manage to understand what it means to provide
psychological safety, though. This post aims to provide a ‘dummies
guide’ to providing psychological safety.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-levels-of-psychological-safety">The basic levels of
psychological safety</h2>
<p>Psychological safety, essentially, is providing a safe nest for the
vulnerable much like an egg is kept safe in a nest with the mother bird
protectively ensuring no predators get close while the egg hatches and
the chicks strengthen their wings for their first flight.</p>
<p>So what does this practically look like in the workplace? There are
three basic levels to psychological safety - material safety, emotional
safety, and the safety to grow and transform.</p>
<h3 id="level-1---material-needs-are-met">Level 1 - Material needs are
met</h3>
<p>Foundational and a pre-requisite for anything else is providing the
confidence that you, as employer, will reliably meet the employee’s
basic needs. That is, they don’t have to worry that they won’t get paid,
or that they will get fired for some unexpected mood or event out of
their control. Basic needs also include the ability to provide
everything they need to do their job effectively.</p>
<p>To reach this level a mutual beneficial contract needs to be agreed
on that both parties consent to. Most work contracts favor the employer
and there’s no or very little room for negotiation. To provide
psychological safety the contract needs to be co-created by both parties
that is equally fair to both sides.</p>
<h3 id="level-2---individual-freedom-and-equality-needs-are-met">Level 2
- Individual freedom and equality needs are met</h3>
<p>The second layer of psychological safety relates to the freedom to
express an individual’s thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. This includes
freedom of speech as well as fair and equal treatment. That is, no
favoritism, nepotism, racism, sexism, or any other -ism that favors one
individual over another based on anything other than meritocracy.</p>
<p>To reach this level roles, responsibilities, expectations, and
boundaries need to be very clearly and explicitly defined. There also
need to be a mechanism that includes everyone equally in decision
making.</p>
<h3
id="level-3---support-to-reach-personal-and-professional-goals">Level 3
- Support to reach personal and professional goals</h3>
<p>The final layer of psychological safety relates to future potential
of an individual and the ongoing support to help the individual grow and
become more. It’s no longer just about the employer and what the
employer wants from the employee, but a mutual beneficial relationship
where both contribute and take in an equal value exchange.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Psychological safety is about allowing authenticity and autonomy. The
underlying message is that you are worthy of your individual dreams and
desires and are equally important than me. For psychological safety to
exist you need to be able to trust each other, and for trust to happen
you need to reliably demonstrate that you take my best interests into
account as much as you take yours into account.</p>

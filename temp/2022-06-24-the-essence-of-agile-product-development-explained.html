    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="debunking-the-spiral-of-ever-increasing-value"><strong>Debunking
the spiral of ever increasing value</strong></h2>
<p>The word <em>“agile”</em> has become somewhat of a controversial term
in many groups. While many organizations and teams claim to be “agile”,
in reality few are. This has caused the essence of agility to be
diluted, not because it isn’t as valuable as it promises to be, but
because it is misunderstood so easily.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey-to-agility-in-just-1-000-steps-and-10-years">The
journey to agility in just 1, 000 steps and 10 years</h2>
<p>Becoming agile is a journey. It’s not a switch that you can simply
turn on. It takes time, and it takes a lot of effort. Mostly, it takes
opening yourself up to try and learn a lot of new things. And fail
often.</p>
<p>When I first came across the world of <a
href="https://funficient.medium.com/10-ways-to-build-quality-into-software-459726031fd5">quality</a>
— which is at the heart of the Scrum process design as I’ll explain
later — it took me the best of 2 years of learning and teaching it to
others to fully understand the concept of quality and the underlying
work of Deming (in which I’m still not an expert to this day). Little
did I know how important this foundation would become later in my
career. At that stage, the word Agile or Scrum didn’t exist mainstream
yet.</p>
<p>The closest concept to an agile coach was Quality Managers —
responsible to align organizations, customer satisfaction and continuous
improvement. Now the label is different and the focus usually on fewer
teams, but the ultimate goal is the same.</p>
<p>When I came across the Theory of Constraints —a process to identify
and support those things that <em>stop</em> you from being productive —
it again took years to master the principles (and I’m far from being a
master in the field).</p>
<p>Psychology, human behavior, change and habits are subjects I’ve
actively been studying for more than 5 years and each day I realize
exactly how little I know. It is, however, the most fundamental goal of
agility. The process of becoming more agile in what you are doing is the
process of changing harmful habits and behaviors into more healthy
ones.</p>
<p>Coaching and the art of asking the right questions to guide a person
towards an answer rather than telling it was one of the hardest skills
I’ve had to develop. It asks you to unlearn everything management has
told you a good ‘manager’ should do for the past 100 years. It
definitely doesn’t take a few days or even a few weeks or even months to
develop and it takes a lot of actual practice, something I practice
whenever I get the opportunity.</p>
<p>Yet, people call themselves agile <em>coaches</em> when most are
unable to pose any questions when dealing with teams, so used to giving
instructions.</p>
<p>Understandable.</p>
<p>Asking doesn’t come natural to us. Traditionally, the manager or
specialist was the one who had the most experience and they saw their
role as telling people how to do something. Asking for help was seen as
a weakness, while in an agile world it is your single biggest
strength.</p>
<p>Becoming agile, similarly to my personal journey, is an ongoing
learning journey. It doesn’t stop. It evolves. It grows. It expands.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<h1 id="lets-talk-about-agile"><strong>Let’s talk about
agile…</strong></h1>
<p>The first mistake most people (including me) make — sometimes out of
laziness (as in in my case) or out of ignorance is using the word to
describe something vastly bigger than what the word actually means. The
word <em>“agile”</em> has been changed from the intended adjective to
describe <em>how</em> software (and specifically software) is developed,
as originally included in <strong><a
href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">the manifesto for agile software
development</a></strong>, into a proper noun <em>“Agile”</em> — to refer
to teams, organizations and even tools. As a result the meaning of the
word has gotten lost in translation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The meaning of the word agile has gotten lost in
translation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where the intent of the manifesto was to serve as north star or
compass to help teams develop software in ways that better responds to
changing requirements and needs, it became an abstract term to describe
anything you wished to perceive as <em>‘better’</em> than other teams,
organizations or processes. If you started using Slack after it was
previously banned in your organization, suddenly this new felt mere
snippet of freedom was considered a sign of organizational agility. If
your team had a Scrum board (even if it was only on Jira or Trello) and
used sticky notes, people deemed themselves as more <em>‘agile’</em>
than those mere mortals who didn’t.The more sticky notes, the more agile
you were. If they had a backlog and daily stand-ups, they were
considered super <em>‘agile’</em> in relation to those doomed to long
sit-down meetings.</p>
<p>The second mistake commonly found is that people shorten the original
manifesto into only the four values which forms the body of a longer
document, omitting the introductory and ending sentences which are
essential to understanding the context of these values and how to use
them.</p>
<p>It is in fact possibly the most important part of the manifesto.</p>
<p>The introductory sentence clearly states that the only way to develop
software in a more agile way is to constantly look for better ways to do
what you already do. It doesn’t end once you’ve worked through it once.
Rather, it advocates for the ability to <em>constantly</em> learn and
improve and adapt. It’s intended to be a <em>starting</em> point of a <a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/a-culture-of-kaizen-2cb8d4ebd6ba">lifelong
learning culture</a>, not a one-pot easy recipe for a single meal.</p>
<p>After the four values, which essentially is a decision making guide,
the manifesto ends with a simple sentence that states that the items on
the right are not wrong as such, the items on the left are just
<em>more</em> valuable than the items on the right.</p>
<p>The manifesto is a decision making framework intended to help you
develop better judgment.</p>
<p>If presented with a choice, for example, people always trump process
and tools, but that doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be <em>any</em>
processes or tools. It merely means that the processes and tools
shouldn’t dictate the development process or restrict the possibility
for people to do their jobs, which in most cases are the truth about
tools and processes in organizations.</p>
<h1 id="the-essence-of-agile-product-development"><strong>The essence of
agile product development</strong></h1>
<p>At the heart of productivity, which I use interchangeably with the
word agile as used by most people, is Deming’s — the father of quality
(not only <em>software</em> quality) — <em>Plan-Do-Check-Act</em> cycle
which is also the essence of the ISO 9001 standard on quality management
systems; as well as the Scrum framework.</p>
<p>The underlying concept that dictates quality, according to Deming’s
work, is that the faster you can get feedback and respond to that
feedback, the higher the chances that you are developing the right
product and thus meeting customer expectations. And quality is
essentially all about meeting expectations.</p>
<p>Like driving a car, when you fall asleep on a long road the rougher
chevron lines will wake you up to enable you to correct yourself and get
back on track. Your focus is on staying as close to the goal as possible
and in order to do that, you always need to know exactly where you are
in relation to where you want to be through feedback and probably more
importantly, by having a clear goal.</p>
<h2 id="clear-goals"><strong>1. Clear goals</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve lost the art of setting meaningful goals, lost in a world
guided by measurable KPI’s and data driven analytics. A good goal is
<em>rarely</em> a number. A good goal contains the reason
<strong><em>why</em></strong> you’re doing it in the first place.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re trying to build trust, maybe you’re trying to connect
buyers and sellers, maybe you’re hoping to create the future of finance
to enable more people to enjoy wealth.</p>
<p>But it’s <strong>not</strong> a 10% increase in user onboarding or to
complete all the stories you picked from the backlog during planning
session with no seemingly connecting golden thread to pull them all
together into a more cohesive goal.</p>
<p>To set a goal, ask yourself:</p>
<p>What are you hoping to achieve when you release the software? What is
the <em>impact</em> of your product or service? What do you hope people
will be able to <em>do</em>?</p>
<p>Without a clear reason or problem to solve, you’re most probably
solving the wrong problem, or solving the problem wrong. You simply
can’t tell the forest from the trees while you’re in it though, so you
won’t notice until it is finally released.</p>
<p>That’s not very agile.</p>
<h2 id="fast-feedback"><strong>2. Fast feedback</strong></h2>
<p>While the goal is essential, as essential is the ability to gain
(<em>and react to</em>) faster feedback from <em>actual</em> users. Not
the analytics. Not the Product Owner or Director of Marketing who sits
in their ivory tower and hasn’t visited an actual customer in months, or
the shareholders who pushes for more profit, but people who use your
product within <em>their</em> context. If you’re developing medical
software, it means visiting the hospital. If you’re developing an AirBnB
or Uber, it means talking to and observing hosts and guest, or drivers
and passengers.</p>
<p><em>Everything</em> in agile software development supports this
single principle of fast feedback — if done correctly.</p>
<p>Having an on-site customer (or representative) to clarify
requirements, or making time to spend with actual users in the field, is
the first opportunity to get feedback faster. Rather than spending
weeks, months or years gathering requirements and designing the perfect
system in your office without windows and isolated from reality,
collaboratively identify and work on only the most important parts with
the focus ensuring you understood their needs and that what you are
doing is helping achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Next is the estimation and backlog grooming sessions where user
stories (requirements) are adapted based on feedback from the developers
early in the development process. Rather than hand over a perfect story
designed in isolation only to find out that technically it isn’t
feasible to build, get technical input early on and adapt your designs
from the word go. There’s no such thing as perfect in the agile world,
so don’t get too attached to your designs or your code. The goal of
agility is to maintain equilibrium between the different moving parts in
order to maintain harmony, much like a surfer has to ride the waves of
the ocean to stay above water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no such thing as perfect in the agile world, so don’t get too
attached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pair programming and Test Driven Development (TDD) are the next
opportunities for rapid feedback in the process of development,
eliminating the need for code reviews as it happens in real-time, while
failing tests written as a first step keeps programmers from tumbling
down the wrong rabbit hole. It’s kind of like a check-list to make sure
nothing is forgotten while getting lost in the code (which is easier
than what most people would like to believe), much like the chevron
lines on the road keeps you from getting too far off the road when you
fall asleep driving.</p>
<p>Next is the review ceremony where small iterations of the product is
presented <strong>as working software</strong> in a demo where the
customer can interact with the software and give feedback immediately
before it is released. Words are a very unreliable source of judging
reality. Telling someone and showing someone are two very different
things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In an agile world, you show - never tell - progress.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-spiral-vs-linear-approach"><strong>3. The spiral vs linear
approach</strong></h2>
<p>Possibly the hardest concept for most people to understand when it
comes to agile software development is that the process is a spiral
rather than a straight line, repeating over and over again adding a
little bit more value with each iteration.</p>
<p>Traditional project management according to PMBOK sees software
development as a project with a defined start and end. It’s a linear
road with a known destination. In reality, however, software doesn’t
have an end and in most cases the destination is rather fuzzy and keeps
changing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no straight lines in nature. Neither in software
development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The software starts, but then it keeps evolving and maintenance is
not something that can be handed over to a maintenance team to fix bugs
on existing code. Rather, it requires a constant refactoring and
changing of features and functions to cater for the changing needs as
more and more users start using it. <em>It’s rather like molding and
remolding soft clay rather than making one pot burnt in the fire to
harden the clay.</em></p>
<p>The difficulty, however, lies in knowing what the core of each
iteration should be. In traditional project management — often compared
with building a house — one thing needs to be completed before adding
the next layer. Foundations are laid before the main structure of the
house is added. The roof and windows can’t be added before the main
structure isn’t complete and the electric wiring and plumbing can only
be done right at the end.</p>
<p>Software development doesn’t work that way though.</p>
<p>In software development the goal is to automate something a user does
to make their use of time more efficient, and they do a lot of complex
stuff all at once and in different variations.</p>
<p>Most systems don’t just do one thing though, they need to do many
things all at once in order to be valuable. Sometimes even conflicting
things and you need to prioritize and choose.</p>
<p>Logging in and onboarding — which can be seen as the foundation of
many systems — is not the most valuable thing to develop first. You
would rather have a skeleton version of the key features to validate the
process as first phase before spending time on onboarding. There’s
little value in wasting a lot of time in perfecting onboarding when you
don’t have a value proposition that will ensure customer retention</p>
<p>The best explanation of this concept I’ve read is from Henrik Kniberg
in his post called <em><a
href="http://(Minimum%20Viable%20Product)%20–%20and%20why%20I%20prefer%20Earliest%20Testable/Usable/Lovable">Making
Sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — and why I prefer Earliest
Testable/Usable/Lovable</a></em> where the concept is summarized in this

<p>The essence of agile software development is the ability to deliver
<strong><em>value</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Value is something that a user can use in its entirety. It is not
valuable for a user to log on without anything else working. It is not
valuable for a user to pull a fancy report when the data is incorrect or
incomplete. It is not valuable for a user to be able to log time without
seeing the results. It is valuable only if it solves a problem.</p>
<p>So each iteration — or sprint — set a goal based on a problem that
needs to be solved.</p>
<h1 id="the-essential-product-development-process"><strong>The essential
product development process</strong></h1>
<p>The graph below attempts to summarise and visualise the essence of
agile product (software and non-software) development following this
spiral model, with each iteration or sprint following an evolving
value-added process going through the same checkpoints on its
journey.</p>

<p>The four main checkpoints, or road signs asking you to stop and
compare actual with reality, consists of the Deming P-D-C-A quality
cycle, briefly explained below:</p>
<h2 id="plan"><strong>1. Plan</strong></h2>
<p>Planning is all about establishing goals. Translating this part of
the process to Scrum would typically include backlog grooming,
estimation and planning meetings.</p>
<p><em>What are you planning to do and what is the highest priority?
What’s your MVP for the next iteration and how will you know you’re
successful?</em></p>
<p>Translating it to the Lean Startup (for more on the difference
between Scrum, Lean and the Lean Startup read <a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/the-difference-between-lean-startup-lean-and-agile-explained-e8ee94806632">here</a>),
this is defining a hypothesis to test.</p>
<p><em>What is the first experiment and how will you measure
success?</em></p>
<p>Translating it to design thinking — which essentially is focused on
the design of the process and mostly includes the aesthetics — it would
be framing the problem — either in a problem statement or a
<strong><em>How Might We</em></strong> question format .</p>
<p>The planning phase is also about assessing the risks associated with
the solution.</p>
<p><em>What are your assumptions and what could possibly go wrong? What
are the riskiest assumptions that needs to be validated first?</em></p>
<h2 id="do"><strong>2. Do</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have a goal set - or <em>thought</em> about what needs to be
done- the next step is to start building it- or the actual
<em>doing</em> the work.</p>
<p>This includes all the activities needed to implement the plan,
including changes to the plan where needed. It also includes testing to
make sure that all the features work. It does not, however, include
automated regression tests as it doesn’t make sense investing in
regression tests when you are not yet sure that the product will be
accepted by the customer. For more on my perspective on automation
testing read <a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/a-lean-approach-to-automation-testing-ad6fcdcf41e3?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">here</a>.</p>
<p>Translating this to Scrum it includes the daily standups, updating of
the Kanban (or Scrum) board and everything usually handled within a
single sprint.</p>
<h2 id="check"><strong>3. Check</strong></h2>
<p>Once the team has developed something tangible, valuable and complete
they show the working software or product to the user to validate. The
main difference between user validation and internal test is that the
user will have systems and processes that does not form part of the
solution as part of their workflow. They will typically use the product
in combination with other parts of their process — not in isolation —
for it to be considered valuable.</p>
<p>The check-phase is intended to be an opportunity for feedback. If the
customer doesn’t use it themselves, you can’t consider it checked. It is
only checked once they’ve physically <em>used</em> it.</p>
<p>Translated to Scrum talk, this is the Review session. Translated to
Lean Startup it is the testing of the hypothesis and translating it to
design thinking it is the user testing.</p>
<h2 id="act"><strong>4. Act</strong></h2>
<p>Feedback is as valuable as what you do with it. It’s of little use
knowing you’re behind schedule but you’re not changing the plan. It’s of
little use when a customer tells you something important in the
delivered product doesn’t solve their problem and you put it on the
bottom of the backlog because it wasn’t planned.</p>
<p>There’s really no point in showing the customer what you’ve done if
you’re not planning to take their feedback as input into the next
planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feedback is as valuable as what you do with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acting means that you are <em>responding</em> to changing
requirements. It’s about spending time to gain <em>insights</em> that
will make you (as a team) as well as the product (what the team is
building) better.</p>
<p><strong>And <em>that</em> is what agility is essentially about. A
core learning loop with fast feedback.</strong></p>
<p>It means that you’re building small pieces and giving the customer
tangible testers to make sure that it’s what they really need and want.
It means that sometimes the priorities change. Sometimes the entire
design changes. Sometimes the whole iteration’s effort is thrown away
(learn more about how to practice this skill with <a
href="https://medium.com/swlh/creating-grit-with-improvement-kata-988802a12fb7">Improvement
Kata’s</a>) because it was the wrong thing. But it is exponentially
better to realize you’re doing the wrong thing after a week or two than
wait a few months to find out.</p>
<p>The act phase can be translated to the retrospective and part of the
review. It is about going back to the drawing board and looking back at
the past iteration actively looking for ways to do it better next round.
Maybe you needed better data to test. Maybe you needed to get a test
account authorised and setup before you could start testing. Maybe you
needed a component library that you could use rather than build
everything from scratch.</p>
<p><em>What can you next time to make it a little bit more efficient and
smooth?</em></p>
<p>Translating this to the Lean Startup it would be the pivot or
persevere question.</p>
<p><em>Do you keep going? Or do you change direction?</em></p>
<p>From a design thinking perspective it is iterating the design or
coming up with new prototypes that better enables the user or solves the
problem, knowing that with each iteration you understand the problem
better.</p>
<h2 id="rinse.-repeat.">Rinse. Repeat.</h2>
<p>Once you’ve completed a full cycle, rinse and repeat, each time
adding more value.</p>
<p><em>And that, my dear reader, is the essence of agility as I see
it.</em></p>

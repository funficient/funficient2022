    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="making-becoming-better-a-habit">Making becoming better a
habit</h2>
<p>I love the performing arts. Dance, especially contemporary dance,
with bodies moving in harmony expressing the language of emotion through
movement. Theater, with the intricacies of what goes on behind closed
doors and the dynamics of relationships from someone else’s perspective.
Live music, standing up in front of hundreds or thousands of people
sharing a piece of your soul in your music.</p>
<p>I love anything where you can see how much blood, sweat and tears
went into producing something that no-one else has ever done before. I
played the piano my entire school career and know how much practice goes
into being able to play one piece really well. So I appreciate when I
see performers showcase what they’ve worked so hard for.</p>
<p>While I’m watching the show I think of how hard they must have
practiced and how much work went into the production. Sometimes I think
it’s crazy spending so much time and effort for only a few night’s worth
of shows. In the same breath I gladly pay for the best seat in the house
just for the pleasure it brings me for the hour or two I witness the
final production. I never dream of buying the cheap seats, and I almost
always buy the CD or program in support of the artists who made it
possible.</p>
<p>In fact, I love art and artists so much that about seven years ago
when I sat down and wrote down a manifesto for my life, it was inspired
mostly by artists I admire. This is what it sounded like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I want to think like Da Vinci, live like Paulo Coelho, grow old
like Jim Hall, and die like the Buddha.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people know Da Vinci, the greatest inventor of all time and my
ultimate hero in life, and many might be familiar with the author Paolho
Coehlo, who is most famous for The Alchemist — a simple story about a
shepard boy who followed his heart — whom I admire for the soul he puts
in his books.</p>
<p>Jim Hall, however, is probably not so well-known. At least, I didn’t
know him until one late night at an international jazz festival in Gent,
Belgium. He was the final artist for the evening after a night of
listening to the top jazz bands perform on stage. When he got onto stage
he immediately grabbed my full attention. For a moment I wondered
whether something was wrong.</p>
<p>An old man of 87 was helped by two men and supported by a cane onto
the stage. I had no idea why such an old man would be taken onto the
stage. It seemed out of place. Barely able to walk on his own, the man
sat down, picked up his guitar, and started jamming. It was Jim Hall.
And as he started playing, the years seem to evaporate from his body and
he was the young hippie again who fell in love with music and decided to
make it into a career.</p>
<p>I didn’t particular like the style of his music, but as I sat
mesmerized with the passion streaming out of his entire body as he
played, I thought <em>that’s</em> how I want to be when I grow old! I
want to be able to do my craft with so much passion until the day I
die.</p>
<h1 id="practice-makes-perfect">Practice makes perfect</h1>
<p>Artists spend 80% or more of their time practicing, preparing, with
nothing to show. For the majority of the life cycle of a production they
fail and fall, just to get up and try again and again until they get it
right. They spend hours perfecting technical skills painfully repeating
it over and over and over again in preparation of the performance.</p>
<p>In sports we see the same. Teams and individuals spend much more time
practicing than what they spend competing or performing. Yet, in
business we tend to jump in and expect ourselves to be perfect without
any practice.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because we think business is easier than the performing
arts or sports, that our brains are so developed already at the age we
start working that we don’t need to practice our thinking anymore. Maybe
it’s because we don’t think we need to get better at our craft. That
we’re born with it or will never be good at it.</p>
<p>Yet, no successful actor, musician, sportsman or even businessman is
an overnight success. When you delve deep enough into their lives there
is not a single one except from the bruises of emotional growth. No
matter how good they are now, they didn’t get there by accident. They
worked at it. Hard.</p>
<p>Even prodigies practice.</p>
<p>So why don’t we? Why do we expect ourselves to be the perfect leader,
the perfect developer, the perfect designer without similar
practice?</p>
<h1 id="the-cycle-of-improvement">The cycle of improvement</h1>
<p>We play it safe in the business world, following only the recipe’s
that’s been proven to work in the past, making us unable to change or
innovate. We become stuck and rigid following processes and methods that
doesn’t apply anymore but we’re too scared of the impact of changing to
try something new.</p>
<p>Or too busy to notice they’re not working anymore. We’re so busy
following old habits that we aren’t able to change our ways.</p>
<p>The world around us <em>is</em> however changing.</p>
<p>That’s why agile was born. Calling for responding to change fast with
no more time to practice in the background until we’ve perfected the
recipe. Allowing us to adapt to change constantly as we respond to the
ever changing environment around us.</p>
<p>At the heart of agile is a cycle of continuous improvement. The
Deming cycle, or P-D-C-A cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) originated in the
1920’s and became the heartbeat of any quality initiative. Both TQM and
ISO9001, the international standard for a Quality Management System, has
at its foundation this cycle of continuous improvement. First you plan
(P) what you want to achieve and how you will measure success, then you
implement (D) the plan. Next you compare the expected results with the
actual results ©, or as Deming proposed, you study the results; and
finally you react (A) by adapting the plan or making a new plan before
trying again.</p>
<p>Science follows the same approach. First you define a hypothesis (P)
usually in the form of IF this THEN that, then you conduct an experiment
to test your hypothesis (D), you check the results © and determine
whether your hypothesis is true or not, adapting the hypothesis or the
before starting again.</p>
<p>User design and game design also follow this cycle, first
constructing a problem statement and a need (or a game idea), then
prototyping a possible solution and testing it before trying again to
make it better.</p>
<h1 id="p-d-c-a-in-scrum">P-D-C-A in Scrum</h1>
<p>All agile methods include this cycle of continuous methods. Scrum,
for example, as a process framework, has the Planning meeting (P),
followed by the sprint (D), then the Review © and finally the
Retrospective (A). The output of one sprint cycle influences the next
sprint cycle.</p>
<p>Typically when you start with Scrum you will find that the team isn’t
able to deliver everything they committed to in the planning session. In
the retrospective you discuss why you couldn’t complete all the planned
stories and agree on what must change to complete all the stories in the
next sprint.</p>
<p>At the following planning session and sprint you change your tactics
based on your learning in the hope that you’ll be able to better meet
your sprint goal this time. And each sprint you get a little better.
Until one day when you finally meet your sprint goal and finish all the
stories you committed to.</p>
<p>But you don’t stop having retrospectives at this point, you continue
improving, taking on more stories, or making space for technical debt
stories, or innovating.</p>
<p>Yet, in business we seem to approach life a bit differently. We think
that once we have the right qualification we’re ready to go. Still so
many people <em>don’t</em> get it right after the qualification. So how
do you apply this scientific process to the business world?</p>
<h1 id="teaching-continuous-improvement-thinking">Teaching continuous
improvement thinking</h1>
<p>The simulation game called <strong><a
href="https://www.funficient.club/improvement-kata.html">Improvement
Kata</a></strong> is designed to teach this process of continuous
improvement.</p>
<p><em>Kata</em> is a Japanese word meaning <em>“form”</em>. It is
mostly used in martial arts to practice a specific form by continuous
exercises. An <em>improvement kata</em> is a concept originating from
Lean Manufacturing to practice continuous improvement.</p>
<p>The Improvement Kata game is explicitly raising awareness of this
cycle of continuous improvement and showing the benefits of practicing
an improvement in a game-like environment.</p>
<p>A simple challenge is presented to the group to order or build a
pattern or artifact, like building a puzzle or assembling a pen from its
different pieces within a set time. Once the time has elapsed, the team
reviews their approach and sets a new target and try again. Each time,
they get a little better until they finally reach the big goal.</p>
<h1 id="why-the-game-works">Why the game works</h1>
<p>The game works for a number of reasons, with three worth pointing
out:</p>
<h1 id="the-power-of-baby-steps">1. The power of baby steps</h1>
<p>Like the story of the tortoise and the hare, it’s not the fastest one
who wins the race, but the one who keeps going at a constant pace. The
story of the tortoise and the hare is about perseverance towards a big,
nearly impossible goal.</p>
<p>The key lesson in the game is that big changes should be approached
in small, iterative steps, learning from failures before taking the next
step. Like climbing a mountain, you don’t reach a big goal with the
first try, you have to keep taking small steps, adapting only one or two
elements at a time and keep going in the right direction. Success is not
a straight line. It looks more like a zigzag up and down.</p>
<p>Many times people tend to make too many changes at once. Usually this
results in more chaos than progress as we don’t know the impact of these
changes on each other, getting unexpected results. When, however, you
make one small change in your strategy you can see the impact and move
forward more effectively. Improvement Kata teaches patience.</p>
<h1 id="overcoming-superhero-syndrome">2. Overcoming superhero
syndrome</h1>
<p>Humans tend to over-estimate what they can do. You think it will take
5 days but then it takes 8. You think you can do it easily, but then run
into an unexpected obstacle or unknown that you didn’t take into
consideration when you planned the task. Almost always, this results in
not meeting the planned deadline.</p>
<p>Your chances of success however incrementally increase when you view
each task as an obstacle you haven’t mastered yet and need to find the
best strategy to do it, rather than jumping in with the one way you
already know how to do it.</p>
<p>When you play Improvement Kata, you become aware of this bias towards
overestimating your ability and practice the skill of finding
alternative ways to approach the same problem. When you are able to find
alternative solutions to the same problem on a regular basis you are
better equipped to deal with encountering unexpected problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Improvement Kata teaches you to become aware of your bias to
overestimate abilities and practice the skill of finding alternative
ways to approach the same problem.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="multiple-lives">3. Multiple lives</h1>
<p>Playing Improvement Kata regularly forms a habit of handling all
problems as overcoming obstacles but without the fear of failure, much
as games do. In a game you usually have more than one life and when you
do fail a level, you simply try again. In real life, however, we only
are given one life, one chance at success, making us resistant to try
alternatives.</p>
<p>We tend to fear trying something new, even though it might be a
better solution, simply because we fear we will loose our one “life”.
Improvement Kata makes us more comfortable to try different solutions,
creating a more flexible mindset who don’t see only one answer to a
problem as we are often taught at school.</p>
<h1 id="flexible-mind">4. Flexible mind</h1>
<p>Learning any new skill creates more connections in our brain. The
more connections you have the more possibilities are present.</p>
<p>Practicing a new habit in different ways don’t reinforce the specific
implementation, but the underlying pattern. When we’re able to recognize
patterns better we are better able to apply different solutions to
different problems.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.katatogrow.com/">original game</a> is
designed with a simple puzzle, however, key to its success is playing it
with other prompts, such as the card game pattern used (as submitted by
Melissa Perri) in the <a
href="https://www.funficient.club/improvement-kata.html">game
instructions,</a> assembling a pen, building lego and even as a <a

<p>The more different ways you play the game, the stronger the
underlying pattern is ingrained into your mind.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-play-improvement-kata">How to play Improvement Kata</h1>
<p>Building new habits is a repetitive process. Scientific research
proves that it is not the duration you spend practicing a new habit that
matters, but the frequency.</p>
<p>Improvement Kata is best done by playing it regularly. It doesn’t
have to be daily, but it has to be repeated at least every few days to a
week using a different prompt.</p>
<p>Start with a very generic metaphor such as the card game in the <a
href="https://www.funficient.club/improvement-kata.html">game
instructions</a>. Ideally it is something most people are familiar with
but is not related to the actual work or process at all. The <a
href="https://www.katatogrow.com/blank">KataToGrow website</a> has a
number of exercises (mostly designed for children) to show examples
which can be modified according to the audience. Any simple task is
suitable.</p>
<p>Another example of this game specifically applied to Scrum is called
the <a
href="https://scrumology.com/from-the-archives-the-ball-point-game/">The
ball point game</a> where the objective is to move a number of balls
through a team with some constraints.</p>
<p>Do this for at least two or three sessions.</p>
<p>Next, move on to draw more alignment to how this skill can be applied
in the work environment. For coders, there is an entire library of
Kata’s on the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/kata/">Coding Dojo</a>
website. Pick any of the kata’s and follow the game instructions as per
usual. After each iteration of code delete all the written code and
start afresh to see if you can do it better.</p>
<p>Continue practicing the skill until it becomes automatic.</p>
<h1 id="getting-better-at-getting-better">Getting better at getting
better</h1>
<p>Whether you’re a developer, a tester, a designer, a manager, an
accountant or a musician, the goal should always be to get better. What
makes us happy and motivates us is not mastery itself, but the feeling
that we are able to master something. It is not in the achievement, but
in the progress that we find joy.</p>
<p>So keep on going. One step at a time.</p>

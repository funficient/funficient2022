<h1 class="title">Do you clearly see your needs?</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

<p>I recently received a job specification from a job placement
consultancy looking for an agile business analyst. It was three pages
long and started with something that sounded like “The Business Analyst
works alongside the Business Owner, Product Owner and Project
Manager.”</p>
<p>This reminded me how flawed agile implementations are in so many
places simply because companies don’t know what they are looking for
when it comes to resources and rely on generic job descriptions and
skills matrixes rather than identifying the need within the company and
the values that they are looking for. They look for credentials and
words on paper to help them decide on a suitable candidate rather than
reading between the lines to see potential and talent based on the
complete profile of the candidate.</p>
<h1 id="eyes-wide-shut">Eyes Wide Shut</h1>
<p>When I responded back to the consultant telling him that the position
is too junior for me and that there wouldn’t be enough authority in the
role to help the company transition towards more agile practices, which
is clearly what they are looking for and what I really want to do, the
answer quickly came back that the company is actually looking for a
senior resource based on feedback from previous candidates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It’s not what you look at, it’s what you see that
matters”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This anonymous quote came to mind as I again felt the frustration of
not being seen for the value I bring to a company in the world of
software development, and on the other hand the employers’ frustration
not finding the resources they are looking for even though it is right
in front of them.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-they-looking-for">What are they looking for?</h1>
<p>What this company, like so many other companies are looking for, is
someone autonomous that will be able to translate the business needs
into techie-talk chunks of requirements that is implementable by
developers. Someone that has adequate vision and judgement to decide on
the priority and realize the impact of changes without adding any risks.
Someone that has the ability to help the developers focus on the right
things, while ensuring that they are delivering value to the
customers.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-they-asking-for">What are they asking for?</h1>
<p>However what they are asking for is someone that is able to write
extensive documents, in this case a BRS (business requirement
specification), a FRS (functional requirement specification) as well as
user stories, without any autonomy in decision making as there is not
only a Project Manager, but also a Product Owner as well as a Business
Owner to consult on any work done.</p>
<p>What they are really asking for, respectfully said, is an intern,
coated in sugar and paid more. Someone that will follow instructions
obediently, while being clever enough not to require too much
supervision. Basically, an extra pair of hands to help out what the
Product Owner can’t get around to do.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-they-need">What do they need?</h1>
<p>What they really need is to resolve the breakdown in communication
between different teams. The lack of functional communication between
the teams causes trust issues, which in turn results in a need for more
proof in the form of extensive documents, which in turn requires more
resources to do the work and deliver.</p>
<p>Realistically however the communication issue is as a result of years
and probably decades of small errors, so it will probably take a while
to resolve and they need something more immediate and concrete to work
with right now.</p>
<p>The immediate need I would recommend is to get a hands-on agile coach
that can work with the Product Owner and Business Owner to help them
better articulate the business needs in actionable tasks for the
developers.</p>
<p>Requirements are the bottleneck stopping the team from delivering and
adding more people to create yet more documents, are the opposite of
what they need to do, even though it seems like the obvious solution to
the problem and the immediate need to alleviate the pressure on the
Product Owner.</p>
<p>They should rather however be looking at someone that can help them
identify how to get rid of documents without risking losing any
intellectual property while they slowly rebuild the bridges of
communication between the teams. They need to learn to trust. Trust
their people, trust their customers, trust their decisions.</p>
<p><em>They need someone to help the Product Owner compile user stories
in a granular enough format that both business and developers will
understand, while keeping the vision and roadmap in mind.</em></p>
<h1 id="less-is-more">Less is More</h1>
<p><em>“More” is mostly a symptom of a bottleneck in your delivery chain
and is rarely an indication of a lack of resources.</em> When you are
constantly struggling in an area and keep adding more, whether it is
documents, people or process, you’ve hit your bottleneck and need to
declutter.</p>
<p>Start questioning who needs the documents and why, and work with all
the key identified stakeholders to systematically get rid of only one
thing per sprint, until you reach a point where all the stakeholders
have exactly what they need, without any extra weight to carry
around.</p>
<h1 id="extra-means-slower">Extra means slower</h1>
<p>When you have more than what you need, it means you need to search
longer for what you are looking for, which in turn means less time for
being productive. It means you need more time to develop the artifacts,
which means less time to deliver value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When you have anything extra, you are not fully agile.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Knowing what you want and knowing what you need are not always that
obvious or easy to spot. The best question to ask next time you consider
adding more, is <strong><em>“Will more speed me up or slow me
down?”</em></strong> and <strong><em>“Will this cost me less than the
value it will bring me?”</em></strong>.</p>

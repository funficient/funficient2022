    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="how-to-find-your-ideal-dapp">How to find your ideal DApp</h2>
<p>I like fantasy. It’s a reality with unlimited possibilities that
exist only in my imagination. What’s even <em>better</em> than something
perfect in my imagination though, is something <em>imperfect</em> in
<em>reality</em>.</p>
<p>Blockchain, and specifically the Ethereum blockchain, is the unicorn
I’ve been looking for. That elusive world of possibilities that breaks
the mold of our current societal beliefs. It makes the impossible
possible. <em>That’s</em> my kind of unicorn!</p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain is kind of like the Google Play Store, except
that it’s no longer for playing only. You can
<strong><em>do</em></strong> <em>a lot</em> with the apps (called
DApps). You can play, but you can also buy and sell on marketplaces,
find a job, exchange tokens, save, borrow and so much more. In fact, the
biggest benefit of the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem is that it has
the potential to totally replace the banking system as we know it.</p>
<p>Like the Google Play Store though, there are so many choices that
it’s really hard to know which one to pick. So I’m embarking on a little
pet-project to curate the available DApps and try to make some sense
from all the chaos. How do you choose the best one for you?</p>
<h2 id="custodial-or-non-custodial">1. Custodial or non-custodial</h2>
<p>Possibly the biggest flaw of our society today is that we trust
blindly. Our bosses, leaders and other authority figures tell us this is
what we should do because it’s for our best interest. But more often
than not it turns out to be in <em>their</em> best interest rather than
ours.</p>
<p>Time to take back your power and make choices based on <em>your</em>
best interest over what someone else believes is best for you. After
all, only <em>you</em> know what you really need and want.</p>
<p>So first and foremost I’ll look at who owns the assets.</p>
<p><strong>Custodial</strong> means it’s similar to a bank where you
freely hand over your assets hoping they will take good care of you. But
ultimately, if you don’t own your assets, you’re not in control of it
and that means it’s not really yours to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Non-custodial</strong> means <em>you</em> take full
responsibility for your assets. No-one to blame when something goes
wrong. But also no-one to exploit you and lead you down the wrong rabbit
hole. <em>No buts.</em> No small print.</p>
<p><em>To read more about what custodial means, read more <a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/custodialaccount.asp">here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="accessibility">2. Accessibility</h2>
<p>Big word that means different things to different people.</p>
<p><em>Ac-cess-i-bi-li-ty.</em></p>
<p>I like to keep things simple though and for me this means <em>your
ability to access the intended functions when you need and want it</em>.
Regardless of where you are, your education level, or whether you have
any disabilities that prevent you from interacting with technology in
the same way as the average Joe on the street.</p>
<p>If you can’t find it or use something when you need it, there’s no
point in having it in the first place. I can do nothing with a MetaMask
account if I can’t deposit funds in it. I can’t earn money on my assets
if I don’t know how to invest it intelligently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Access-ability. Your ability to access something.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me that means everything that relates to your ability to access
the DApp. It includes support of different geographic locations and
currencies, because there’s no point in downloading the fanciest app but
you can’t be KYC’ed in the country you live.</p>
<p>It also includes whether it’s available as a web app or a mobile app
or both <em>(in my opinion, everything should be progressive web
apps!)</em>. One of the most annoying features (in my opinion) of native
over progressive apps is that you can’t do what you can on the web app
version and vice versa, which impedes the accessibility of the
functions.</p>
<p>Ask yourself <em>“Can I find it?”</em> and <em>“Can I use it when I
need it?”</em></p>
<h2 id="trust">3. Trust</h2>
<p>This is a hard one, as trust is much more complex than a simple yes
or a no. <em>It depends.</em></p>
<p>Each person might need different things to trust an app, but this is
how I decide whether something can be trusted or not:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>A whitepaper</strong> and <strong>security audit</strong>
available on the website, with proof that the audit issues are being
looked at or resolved.</li>
<li>Is it <strong>open source</strong> that can be audited by any member
of the public and its users?</li>
<li>At least three <strong>independent</strong> sources I trust gives a
positive <strong>review</strong> on the product.</li>
<li><strong><em>Say what you do. Do what you say.</em></strong> No shiny
promises or buts or hidden small print. If you say you can do something
you must be able to do that something.</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, the main question to ask is <em>“Does it live up to its
promise?”</em> and on the shadow side <em>“Are there any hidden
agendas?”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="usability">4. Usability</h2>
<p><em>If it is not easy, it doesn’t work.</em></p>
<p>This is probably the biggest differentiation between the winners and
the losers in the overcrowded tech space.</p>
<p>Usability means a lot. More than what can be described in one
paragraph, but simply put, it relates to <em>how easy it is to do what
you want to do</em> with this tool.</p>
<p>It always boils down to purpose and goals and your ability, and the
efficiency, in being able to achieve a goal with the least amount of
friction and cognitive overload.</p>
<p>Usability very much relates to how we think and decide and a subject
I’m super passionate about. The primary questions to ask are <em>“Is it
easy?”</em> and <em>“Does it solve a real problem for me?”</em></p>
<h2 id="available-features">5. Available features</h2>
<p>The terminology used in the Ethereum space can be extremely
confusing. A wallet to one person means something different than to
someone else. There isn’t a standard shared library of words that
clearly define what something is. Yet.</p>
<p>To make it easier, and to clarify the confusion, I’ll list the main
features as jobs-to-be-done relatable to an average person.
<strong><em>Argent</em></strong>, for example, has a wallet, but they
also offer a bunch of other banking features. You can deposit money, you
can exchange coins, you can save, borrow etc.
<strong><em>Luno</em></strong>, on the other hand, also a wallet, offers
a fraction of the options and can hardly be compered. They had (until
about a week ago) two supported currencies vs close to a hundred (I
stopped counting at 40…) on Argent. They offer a simple buy and sell,
whereas Argent offers integration to a few of the existing protocols
allowing you to trade, save and borrow.</p>
<p>Questions to ask are <em>“What can it do?”</em> and <em>“How complete
is the service offering?”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="cross-chain-support-and-integration">6. Cross-chain support and
integration</h2>
<p>Monopolies are bad. Usually, they are there in the first place
because of a selfish intention. <em>Sharing</em> is caring.</p>
<p>It is extremely important that blockchain technology remains
community owned (or decentralized) and that there are always
alternatives available. By default most of the DApps are open-source and
most have API’s available to build on each other like lego blocks. This
helps the growth as well as the usability to a large degree. Integration
is thus a big deciding factor as to whether one DApp is better than
another.</p>
<p>On top of this, cross-chain support is a big deciding factor for good
long-term investment decisions. When there’s bridges between different
blockchains, the security risk doubles.</p>
<p>I don’t ever want to feel locked into something without the ability
to get out, as what I did until recently with the banking system.</p>
<p><em>There should always be a choice.</em> And there should always be
a fair competitor to keep things in the best interest of everyone. The
ability to transact across chains within an app is thus a big decider
for me.</p>
<h2 id="support">7. Support</h2>
<p>The DApp world is pretty new and that means that it’s far from
perfect. Usability should definitely be the first priority in terms of
design, however support is equally important to make one DApp better
than another.</p>
<p>The level of support available and the quality of support is a
crucial decider for me. It’s simply not good enough to wait a week to
get a response for a financial transaction.</p>
<h2 id="fees">8. Fees</h2>
<p>Pricing is often the difference between a product being a success or
a failure. Make it too cheap and you don’t have a sustainable business.
Make it too expensive and no-one uses it or expects too much from
it.</p>
<p>If I’m going to make use of your DApp, I want to at least have some
surety that it will still be there in a year from now.</p>
<p>The fee structure is also an indication of the trustworthiness of an
application or business in my opinion. You can see a business’ intention
in their pricing just as you can clearly see the culture and level of
agility by interacting with a product (or I can at least because I know
what to look for) or the people who work there.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Ownership, trust, accessibility, usability and functions.</p>
<p>These are the things most important to me in deciding whether one
DApp is better than another one.</p>

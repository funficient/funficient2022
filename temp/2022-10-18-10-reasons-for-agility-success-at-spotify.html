    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>Agile transformations are not easy. Like the elusive pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow, becoming agile is an ever-changing goal with no
defined road to get there. It requires changing what you do, how you do
it, and most importantly, how you think about it, all without a manual
or detailed guide. You are provided with merely a one-pager containing
four values followed by twelve principles. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Perplexingly difficult, yet magnificently
simple.</em></strong></p>
<p>Understandably, this results in a lot of failed agile transformations
where organizations have adopted the physical practices such as
participating in daily standups or having a Scrum Board but without a
mindset change. The result? Making the same mistakes faster, without the
data and evidence to analyse and correct the errors later on.</p>
<p><em>So how do you succeed in an agile transformation?</em></p>
<h1 id="look.-launch.-learn.">Look. Launch. Learn.</h1>
<p><em>At the heart of being agile is an immense ability to learn, and
to apply this learning to improve how things are being done.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agile is a journey, not a destination. Which means you need a map
and a compass to get you to your destination.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is an agile transformation model, adapted from the work of
<strong>John Shook</strong> and the <strong>Toyota Lean
Manufacturing</strong> model, to serve as a map, while your compass will
be your organizational measures and the emotions of the stakeholders —
both the customers as well as the internal employees. <em>If the results
are good, you’re moving in the right direction. If what you do, or how
you do it feels good, you’re right on track. If it feels good AND the
results are good — bingo! You’ve hit the jackpot!</em></p>
<p>And then it starts all over again. Been there, done that, got the
T-shirt. Now what?</p>
<p><img

<p>An Agile Transformation Model adapted from the Toyota Production
System</p>
<p><em>For an agile transformation to be successful, it needs a strong
foundation based on shared values and an <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-does-an-agile-mind-look-like-12f21cb3a20#.bpxhvuukc">agile
mindset</a>.</em> You also need a vision focused on solving a problem
and adding value to the users, as depicted by the roof, providing
purpose for the existence of the organization. In the centre, and
supported on all sides, is the leader, who is the glue that keeps
everything aligned.</p>
<p>The two pillars on either side of the leader ensures balance and
focuses on <em>“How?”</em> work is done in the organization, rather than
<em>“Why?”</em> it is done as governed by the vision. To the left are
processes and tools, which are designed to empower and simplify work
while ensuring consistent results. On the right are the people and the
skills needed to do the work, including both technical and soft skills
needed to instill and support the culture and mindset.</p>
<h1 id="spotify">Spotify</h1>
<h2 id="a-case-study-of-a-successful-agile-transformation">A case study
of a successful agile transformation</h2>
<p>One company that succeeded in adopting agile is
<strong>Spotify</strong>, the music, podcast and video streaming service
that disrupted the way people discover and use music. <em>So why did
they succeed while so many other companies failed?</em></p>
<p>Looking at the above model as reference for their success, below is
ten reasons for their success.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> All the references and facts
mentioned are based on my personal and objective research. I’ve never
worked or interacted with Spotify thus is open to any
corrections.</em></p>
<h2 id="born-out-of-passion">1. Born out of passion</h2>
<p>The first reason for their success, and probably the most important
one, can be found by looking at their CEO and the company vision. The
CEO, Daniel Ek, himself was a failed musician and have always been
passionate about music after receiving a guitar and Commodore 10
computer at the age of 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When passion is the driving force behind your work, you’ll do
whatever it takes to succeed. Giving up is not an option.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-vision-that-disrupts">2. A vision that disrupts</h2>
<p>Spotify saw a problem that no one even realized they had yet. They
realized that the format that music was distributed in restricted the
amount of time you could listen to it, where you could listen to it, and
who you could listen to in one session.</p>
<p>On a typical CD you can only listen to 60- 90 minutes of music, and
only when you have a CD player. Mostly, you can only listen to the same
artists, or a variety of artists and songs chosen by someone else and
not necessarily to your taste.</p>
<p>Where most people accepted this as a slight irritation to live with,
they used this frustration as fuel for innovation. Spotify didn’t accept
that this was the way things are done in the music industry, they
changed the way it was done.</p>
<h2 id="problem-or-opportunity">3. Problem or opportunity?</h2>
<p>Most music distributers and musicians saw the impact of the internet
on music and the increasing trend of illegal streaming as a problem.</p>
<p>Spotify, on the other hand, embraced these trends and used it to
create a solution that addresses these unexpressed needs of the
consumers, while at the same time helping the musicians create more
great music and market themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spotify saw an opportunity where others saw a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="clarity">4. Clarity</h2>
<p>The company’s vision is crystal clear, namely to help improve people
and musician’s lives by helping more people discover more music, in an
accessible and legal way. That means that the company consistently
delivers on their brand promise — something that not a lot of companies
can say they do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their vision is clear, actionable, and specialized. It’s not
unrealistic or vague, rather, it is very focused, precise and
actionable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a clear, actionable and focused vision has the added benefit
of making decisions related to priorities easier. Each time a new
product request comes in, questions can be asked to validate whether the
request will enhance or distract the user from a delightful user
experience. Typically, they could ask questions such as:</p>
<p><em>“Does this feature make a listener’s life better?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is this feature accessible to everyone, everywhere?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Will the feature result in people caring more about the music
and the musicians that create the music?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Will it help a musician create more great music?”</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the vision is clear and actionable, product development becomes
easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="culture-is-king">5. Culture is King</h2>
<p>While the vision is the north star telling you <em>“what”</em> to do,
the culture and mindset creates an environment that helps teams know
<em>“how”</em> to do it. A culture might not be tangible, but it can be
clearly defined as Spotify has demonstrated.</p>
<p>Spotify invested effort in creating two short <a
href="http://youtu.be/Mpsn3WaI_4k">videos</a> to clarify what is most
important to them, and to answer <em>“how”</em> things are done at
Spotify, in a similar, unrestricted format than the agile manifesto. It
provides a framework for decision making rather than a set of rules to
follow.</p>
<p>For example, cross-pollination is more important than standardization
to Spotify, and community is more important than structure. It doesn’t
say that structure is not important, or defines the exact structures to
be used, it allows the teams to adapt and use a structure used by other
teams when they see value in it.</p>
<p><em>Spotify’s culture helps clarify how decisions are made within the
organization, not how work are, or should, be done.</em></p>
<h2 id="mindset-matters">6. Mindset matters</h2>
<p>The mindset of an organization is driven by the leader.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many companies broadcast their values on screensavers,
cups, websites and T-shirts for everyone to see, yet when you start
interacting with the people that work there, you quickly realize that
no-one really follows or believes in it.</p>
<p>The difference with Spotify is that their leader instills and
promotes the mindset that he wants the people to follow. A <em>‘do what
I do’</em> model, rather than the <em>‘do what I say, not what I
do’</em> model so common in many workplaces.</p>
<p>On the many YouTube video’s where Daniel Ek is interviewed, he
demostrates each of the values that is contained in the videos
elaborating on the Spotify culture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With a clear example and consistency in following throught on it,
instilling a culture becomes the natural by-product of everyday
life.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people and the customers provide input into the vision and the
mindset, but in the end of the day, it is the leader who is the
rolemodel responsibile for the success or failure of any culture. When
you say autonomy is important, but you micro-manage, the culture will be
one of micro-management and not taking responsibility. Regardless of how
many places and how many times you repeat and display the value on
walls, cups or screensavers.</p>
<h2
id="processes-and-tools-support-rather-than-drive-the-organization">7.
Processes and tools support, rather than drive the organization</h2>
<p>The processes and tools at Spotify support the value of change and
agility, with everything clearly defined, and nothing final. Like a
beehive, there is a structured, or rather balanced, kind of chaos, where
the processes are constantly changing.</p>
<p>The processes support the vision and the people, not the other way
around. Where so many organizations drive the organization based on the
restrictions of the processes and tools, Spotify changed their entire
architecture to support the delivery train concept.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-is-key">8. Collaboration is key</h2>
<p>Guilds and squads all work together, sharing knowledge and supporting
each other. They help each other where possible, rather than competing
against each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no loser. There are only winning teams, and it is all driven
by finding a winning solution to serve the customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each person is respected, and each person respects their peers. There
is no one person more important than another, there are only different
people that are important at different times, or for different
reasons.</p>
<h2 id="happiness-matters">9. Happiness matters</h2>
<p>The people are the most important part of the equation for success
and the entire company is built around motivating and engaging their
employees.<br />
When they had a customer satisfaction survey and 91% of people responded
that they were happy, with 4% that they were not happy, the feedback
from managment was to ask what can they do to make the 4% unhappy
employees happier.</p>
<p>Most companies would disregard the unhappy few as outliers and be
happy with ‘good enough’ results. Spotify, however, demonstrates the
value of respect and trust by addressing the needs of the 4% unhappy
employees. They make everyone important (respect), and they trust that
people who are unhappy, have a valid reason, and it is worth addressing
these needs.</p>
<h2 id="autonomy-empowers">10. Autonomy empowers</h2>
<p>Autonomy is one of the success factors for any agile organizations,
and Spotify are one of few companies that actually got it right. They
don’t tell anyone how to do their job, but whenever someone has a
question or need guidance, they are fully supported and helped by those
around them.</p>
<p>It means that you need to be confident enough to make decisions on
your own. Humble enough to ask for guidance or admit you don’t know the
answer. Responsible enough to proactively act even though it’s not in
your job description. Curious enough to constantly look for better ways
to do things.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To successfully transition towards an agile model, the most important
element is having purpose driven by passion and strong leadership to
demonstrate the values and mindset of an agile culture.</p>

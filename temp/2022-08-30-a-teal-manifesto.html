<h2 id="a-vision-for-the-future-of-organizations">A vision for the
future of organizations</h2>
<p>In his book <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/reinventing-organizations-a0babc967488">Reinventing
Organizations</a>, Frederic Laloux defines the different paradigms in
organizational development to a specific color starting with red, moving
on to amber, orange, green and finally teal. Teal organizations are the
most developed and can be considered the adult compared to the red
infant organization.</p>
<p>His book analyses a number of organizations and he defines the main
characteristics of organizations operating from a teal paradigm, but he
doesn’t specify a manifesto for these organizations as such, and this
post aims to start that process, by defining the four most important
values and inviting input and discussion to refine it.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="purpose-over-profit">Purpose over Profit</h2>
<p>Most importantly, an organization operating from a teal paradigm puts
purpose at the forefront of the organization’s existence, starting with
why. The purpose of a teal organization drives the decisions and the
structure of the organization and profit is more the result of the work
than the goal in itself.</p>
<p><em>That doesn’t mean profit is not important, it means that
decisions are governed more by purpose than by profit.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of a teal organization is usually evolutionary and
meaningful, providing a much needed service or solving a problem, like
Buurtzorg, one of the organizations considered by Laloux as operating
from a teal paradigm, who aims to change the nursing service in the
Netherlands to focus on the needs of the patients first and improving
their quality of live through caring service.</p>
<h2 id="soul-over-role">Soul over Role</h2>
<p>In most organizations preceding teal, the roles are the primary
driver that determines the structure and people need to bend to fit into
roles which are not necessarily a true fit for them personally — both
skills and personality wise.</p>
<p>In organizations operating from a teal perspective, the people’s
skills and needs are considered more important than the role. This means
that there are no hard and fast roles where in order to succeed an
individual has to master all the skills required by that role. <em>It
also means that roles are more personalized with the person fulfilling
the role in the organization is viewed as a puzzle piece that is needed
to fill a specific skills gap. There is an overlap between the
organizational needs and the individual’s needs.</em></p>
<p><em>It also means that work and personal life aren’t separated and
the emotional, physical and spirtual needs of the individuals are
included in the work environment.</em></p>
<h2 id="sensing-and-responding-over-predicting-and-controlling">Sensing
and Responding over Predicting and Controlling</h2>
<p><em>Teal organizations are organizations who value equilibrium with
its surroundings, always aiming to remain in harmony with the
environment. Rather than trying to predict and control the environment,
it moves in harmony with it, embracing the changes and reacting to these
changes.</em></p>
<h2 id="art-over-automation">Art over Automation</h2>
<p><em>In organizations operating primarily from a teal perspectives,
everything is viewed as an art. Leaderhip as an art, nursing as an art,
producing products as an art. Where during the industrial age quality
was mainly measured by the ability to produce exact replicas, during the
knowledge age, personalization is what differentiates one organization
from the next.</em></p>
<p>It uses technology to improve and augment, and where a job can be
automated, it is, with the goal of freeing up the resources to do more
creative work than boring and repetitive work that no-one wants to do
and a machine is better at.</p>

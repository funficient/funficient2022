    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>Hiring is risky. If you’re lucky enough to find the right person they
drastically contribute to the success of your company.  Making an
unlucky mistake and hiring a bad apple, on the other hand, can
negatively influence your entire organization.  This is another post in
the teal series to map out possible futures of what teal practices might
practically look like based on the book <a
href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reinventing-Organizations-Creating-Inspired-Consciousness/dp/2960133501/ref=asc_df_2960133501/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310762413837&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9430758738800536540&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1006736&amp;hvtargid=pla-491392026609&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Reinventing
Organizations</a> by Frederic Laloux.  This post focuses on what teal
hiring might look like.</p>
<p>First, we’ll highlight the main practices in a predominantly orange
paradigm, then what ‘teal’ hiring might look like, and finally, a rough
guide to help you transition from <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">orange
to teal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="orange-hiring-practices">‘Orange’ hiring practices</h2>
<p>In a traditional ‘orange’ organization hiring is usually initiated by
writing a detailed <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/05/22/5-reasons-reading-the-job-description-is-key-to-securing-that-job/">job
description</a>. After the job description has been advertised, people
submit resumes to initiate a long and time-intensive interview
process.</p>
<p>The interview process mainly consists of verbal conversations.
Experience is the primary measure of success rather than potential or
personal career advancement opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="human-resources-own-hiring">Human resources own hiring</h3>
<p>Typically, a recruiter trained in Human Resources filters out
resumes. Only candidates who match the job description are passed on to
the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/03/21/hiring-managers/">hiring
manager</a>. This often means people who are either not good at
presenting themselves or don’t include the checklist items the recruiter
is looking for, are filtered out.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this process is to filter out unwanted
candidates rather than to find talent.</p>
<h3 id="interview-based-hiring">Interview based hiring</h3>
<p>If a person manages to pass the cultural fit they are invited to an
interview with the hiring department manager. This interview typically
focuses on verifying the information in the resume.  The candidate’s
personality is also evaluated to see if it is a fit for the manager. 
The team that the person will work with often never meets the new hire
before their start date.</p>
<h3 id="permanent-hire-decisions">Permanent hire decisions</h3>
<p>When everyone agrees, the candidate is offered a full-time contract.
There is usually a 3 – 6 months probation period before a contract
becomes binding, however, the intent when making the offer is that the
person will <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/04/16/get-enthusiastic-team-members/">become
a long-standing team member</a>.</p>
<p>This means a lot of time and money gets invested upfront, making
hiring expensive and very risky.  Sometimes as much as a full month is
dedicated to training before a person is entrusted with more productive
work.</p>
<h2 id="teal-hiring-practices">Teal hiring practices</h2>
<p>Where the focus of hiring in a predominantly ‘orange’ organization is
based on fit with the job description, ‘teal’ hiring focuses on fit for
purpose and culture.</p>
<p>Teal hiring also evaluates mindset to a bigger degree.  <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/02/15/responsibility/">Personal
qualities like responsibility</a> or creative problem-solving are other
focus areas during the initial evaluation.</p>
<p>Another key difference in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/03/30/lensa-ai/">approaching
hiring</a> is to reduce risk. Teal hiring handles recruitment more like
a growing relationship rather than a logical once-off decision.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-considerations">Evaluation considerations</h3>
<p>Rather than look for a match to a defined job description, the focus
when <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/12/teal-organizations/">Teal
organizations</a> hire is on problem-solving.</p>
<p>Typically, the job description is a problem statement, inviting
candidates to submit possible solutions. Thus, regardless of the
specific skill set the candidate might have in terms of experience, the
focus is on how they can <em>apply</em> these skills.  This approach
gives much more insight into what is important to a person and how they
think.  It is also a great way to evaluate the alignment between the
person and the organization’s purpose and values.</p>
<h3 id="the-team-owns-hiring">The team owns hiring</h3>
<p>Another key difference between ‘orange’ hiring and ‘teal’ hiring is
who initiates the process. In a ‘teal’ organization anyone can initiate
hiring. Whenever there is a need to add a skill to the team, the hiring
process can be initiated.</p>
<p>As the team understands their challenges best and knows what they
need, they are responsible for finding the right person to complete the
team.</p>
<p>The team may typically present a business case to get approval for
the expense of hiring following the advice process, or other processes
if defined by the organization. They then also are responsible to find
the right person, often in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/11/06/unconventional-leader/">unconventional</a>
and unique ways.</p>
<h3 id="evidence-based-hiring">Evidence-based hiring</h3>
<p>Another trend popping up with hiring more aligned with ‘teal’
practices is to rely on anonymous talent assessment tests. This greatly
reduces the effects of unconscious bias as candidates are matched based
on their cognitive and personality skills rather than presentation,
gender, age, race, or other discriminating demographics.</p>
<h3 id="contract-vs-full-time">Contract vs full-time</h3>
<p>As everyone is considered an autonomous and equal partner, contracts
are often more flexible and preferred over full-time jobs. Everyone is
considered as an independent contract, responsible for their benefits in
an adult-to-adult relationship based on the transactional analysis
model.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the parent-child relationship of a typical
‘orange’ organization where the employer serves much like a parent,
responsible for saving for a pension and providing medical benefits.</p>
<p>Of course, this is very unique to each organization. Several partners
or employees can, for example, come together and decide to contribute to
a mutual emergency or medical fund.</p>
<p>The key is that everyone part of the organization is treated as an
independent, responsible partner rather than ‘owned’ as a full-time
employee.</p>
<h3 id="value-based-remuneration">Value-based remuneration</h3>
<p>Remuneration is also more flexible in a ‘teal’ organization and is
dependent on the role. For example, in a retail environment where it is
important to have someone present during specific hours, time is the
basis for payment. For knowledge work, though, remuneration tends to be
project-based or value-based rather than time-based.</p>
<p>Remuneration is decided upon based on the desired
<em>outcome</em>.</p>
<h3 id="creative-and-community-based-recruiting">Creative and
community-based recruiting</h3>
<p>Recruitment is typically done in a more creative way in ‘teal’
organizations. Rather than relying on posting job specifications and
waiting for candidates to apply, recruiting might be more proactive.</p>
<p>For example, companies might host regular meetups where they can
interact with people in a more casual setting. Or maybe they invite
participants to join their Slack or Discord community where they can
interact with people more intimately without any expectations.</p>
<p>This gives much more insight into the relationship dynamics when in a
team setting. It also allows a more realistic evaluation of skills over
time.</p>
<p>When the need arises, these forums can also be used to invite
applications.</p>
<h3 id="trail-paid-projects">Trail paid projects</h3>
<p>Another common trend that replaces upfront full-time hiring is
inviting several candidates to participate in trial-paid projects. If
the person isn’t a good fit no one loses anything and no one has to be
fired.  They are simply not invited to a follow-up project or offered a
more long-term contract.</p>
<p>If, however, someone is a good match both culturally and technically,
they are invited to be added to the resource pool for future projects.
It also means the financial risk of being responsible for paying
salaries is not only on the employer.  The risk is split when work is
handled on a project-based basis.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-from-orange-to-teal">How to get from orange to
teal</h2>
<p>Hiring is one of the easiest areas to transition. It is simply a
matter of deciding what best fits your organization and then starting
with the next person required.  However, here is a rough road map that
might help you transition:</p>
<h3 id="define-problems-and-outcomes">1. Define problems and
outcomes</h3>
<p>Rather than rely on static job descriptions, spend some time
analyzing and defining the current problem and the desired outcomes you
wish to achieve by hiring someone.</p>
<h3 id="adapt-contracts">2. Adapt contracts</h3>
<p>Adapt contracts to offer project-based or value-based contracts and
remuneration for new hires.  When this becomes the more accepted means
of hiring, consider renegotiating full-time contracts with existing
employees. Always honour their initial contract, offering them the
alternative should they choose to.</p>
<h3 id="develop-a-community-platform">3. Develop a community
platform</h3>
<p>Decide who you want to include in a community, what level of
interaction you are looking for, and the level of investment required
from your team as a result.  For example, do you need to appoint a
dedicated community manager?  Or will you moderate conversations
yourself?</p>
<p>Community is one of the most important parts of the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/11/14/future-of-work/">future
of work</a>.  It goes far above and beyond hiring and a future post will
delve into more details on community best practices.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>Hiring is risky.  It is risky for the employer, and it is as risky
for the employee.  In a typical orange paradigm where the business is
viewed as a well-oiled machine, parts (or resources) can simply be hired
and fired as the need arises.  In a teal paradigm, however, the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/12/03/well-being/">well-being</a>
of the entire organism is impacted when one part’s well-being isn’t
taken into consideration.</p>
<p>It makes sense to move to a more organic way to view hiring as a
relationship rather than ownership.</p>

    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 class="title">The impact of fear on productivity</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

</header>
<p>The best things in life are free.  Breathing fresh air.  A walk on
the beach.  Being hugged by a loved one.  Hearing the words “I am sorry”
or “I love you”.  Yet, often we measure our worth by the <em>things</em>
we have, rather than the experiences we share. Our view of productivity
tends to be similar.  We often look at expensive high-tech tools to
increase and measure productivity, overlooking the free and readily
accessible low-tech solutions available to us.  One of these overlooked
solutions is changing behaviors and specifically the impact of fear on
productivity.</p>
<p>Behaviors have more influence on productivity than any technology
tool I’ve encountered.  Ultimately, it is the people who use, implement
and support the tools.  When they don’t feel motivated or believe in the
tool, they will sabotage or misuse it.</p>
<h2 id="garbage-in-garbage-out">Garbage in, garbage out</h2>
<p>The best systems and tools in the world are as good as the data that
goes into it.  It’s the behaviors, not the tools, that make a tool or
process productive or not.</p>
<p>Behaviors either support or impede people to produce more with fewer
resources.  Behaviors that encourage productivity improvements include
<a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/08/26/create-culture-respect/">respect</a>,
<a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/08/18/5-ways-build-culture-of-trust/">trust</a>,
compassion, forgiveness, and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/12/11/transparent-leader/">transparency</a>. 
They build an engaged and motivated workforce, who will do whatever it
takes to overcome obstacles and eliminate bottlenecks.  A <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/03/19/motivate-and-engage-your-team/">motivated
and engaged team</a> can do anything.  They will go that extra mile to
make miracles happen.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-impediment-to-productive-teams">The biggest
impediment to productive teams</h2>
<p>Compared to the best technology in the world, motivation as a
productivity tool by far outperforms technology of any kind.  After all,
it is people who build technology. Motivated teams build <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/10/19/age-of-technology/">high-quality
technology</a>.  Demotivated teams build in errors, get the requirements
wrong and solve the wrong problems. They experience the impact of fear
on productivity.</p>
<p>There are many behaviors that demotivate and impact productivity. 
The biggest impediment by far impacting productivity and motivation is
fear.  When people feel <a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/unpacking-psychological-safety-9f157ef3c8ca">unsafe</a>,
it is impossible to perform at optimum levels of performance.  Where in
a motivated space energy is focused on problem solving and creativity,
in a fear-driven environment energy is spent on defending and protecting
yourself.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons not to manage by control and fear include:</p>
<h2 id="fear-distracts-you-from-your-productive-work">1. Fear distracts
you from your productive work</h2>
<p>When managed by fear, employees focus on staying safe.  They spend
time gathering evidence to protect them from any possible disciplinary
actions.   Time that could have been spent on producing results is spent
on looking for evidence to protect them from perceived danger.</p>
<h2 id="fear-increases-the-need-for-switching-between-tasks">2. Fear
increases the need for switching between tasks</h2>
<p>Employees managed by means of fear tend to switch more between tasks,
in an attempt to look more productive than what they really are.</p>
<p>They, for example, spend time on the internet, which might look
unproductive at a glace, but ultimately supports their productivity. 
They don’t stop doing the tasks not directly assigned to them, they find
ways to do it secretly. Additionally, they attempt to hide it from their
manager and switch to more productive work whenever the manager walks
past.</p>
<p>Each time they switch between tasks, they need extra time to focus
their attention on the new task, decreasing their productivity.</p>
<h2 id="fear-limits-creative-thinking-and-problem-solving-ability">3.
Fear limits creative thinking and problem-solving ability</h2>
<p>When people are scared that they might be reprimanded or fired when
they make a mistake, they refrain from coming up with solutions.  They
are unable to think clearly, let alone creatively, fearing they might be
punished for not producing the results exactly as the manager wants
it.</p>
<h2 id="fear-is-debilitating-causing-you-to-be-less-productive">4. Fear
is debilitating, causing you to be less productive</h2>
<p>In extreme situations, fear can be debilitating, rendering an
employee unable to do any work, fully realising the impact of fear on
productivity.</p>
<h2 id="fear-increases-doubt">5. Fear increases doubt</h2>
<p>People who feel unsafe tend to doubt themselves.  They might know the
right thing to do but will refrain from taking action because they are
not sure whether the action will be punished or rewarded.</p>
<h2 id="fear-causes-procrastination">6. Fear causes procrastination</h2>
<p>Fear causes people to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/06/13/overcome-procrastination/">procrastinate</a>,
unwilling to move forward because they fear to take the wrong action or
ask the wrong question.  They would rather spend time and energy finding
ways to look busy than risk doing something they are not 100% sure will
be accepted.</p>
<h2 id="fear-breaks-down-and-inhibits-communication">7. Fear breaks down
and inhibits communication</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of managing by fear is the break
down in <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/12/22/answer-life-universe-everything/">communication</a>. 
People are afraid to raise issues, point out gaps or errors in the
process, and ask questions.  They will spend time doing the wrong work,
rather than to clarify an issue.</p>
<p>This impacts productivity not only directly, by not doing productive
work, but also indirectly, by causing you to redo the same work at a
later stage.</p>
<h2 id="fear-hides-problems">8. Fear hides problems</h2>
<p>When problems can be seen, they can be fixed. When people are afraid
to raise issues, they tend to spend their energy trying to hide it. 
That doesn’t mean that the problem goes away, it merely means it will
most probably remain undiscovered until a customer discovers it.  This
impacts both the productivity and the reputation of the
organization.</p>
<h2 id="fear-causes-confusion-by-blurring-the-goal">9. Fear causes
confusion by blurring the goal</h2>
<p>When people are afraid, their perception becomes limited.  Their fear
will drive them to take the first action right in front of them, not
spending the time to think about whether this helps them achieve their
goal or not.  The more they act without thinking, the more blurred the
goal becomes until finally, everyone is confused and unproductive.</p>
<h2 id="fear-lowers-motivation">10. Fear lowers motivation</h2>
<p>You can only feel one emotion at a time, just as you can only focus
on one task at a time.  When someone experiences fear, they’re not able
to feel motivated.</p>
<p>On the emotional scale, moving downwards, towards the more negative
emotions, is much easier than moving up towards positivity.  Fear thus
lowers motivation and makes it much harder to get back to the same level
of motivation as before.</p>
<h2 id="driving-out-fear">Driving out fear</h2>
<p>Dr Deming, the father of the Quality evolution, came up with a list
of <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newSTR_75.htm">14
principles of management</a> to improve the effectiveness of a
business.  These principles form the foundation of the Toyota Way, a
philosophy and methodology followed by Toyota, and the reason for
turning it around from close to bankruptcy to one of the highest
performance and most respected businesses in the world.</p>
<p>One of his 14 principles for an effective and productive business is
to drive out fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must preserve the <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/12/10/intrinsic-motivation/">power
of intrinsic motivation</a>, dignity, cooperation, curiosity, joy in
learning, that people are born with.” – Dr W Edwards Deming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Deming believed that a problem can only be solved when you know
about it.  He also believed that the people who know what’s really going
on, are the people doing the work.  It is thus crucial to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/10/18/create-a-workplace-culture/">creating
a safe environment where the people on the ground feel</a> free to
express their ideas and voice potential problems.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-drive-out-fear">How do you drive out fear?</h2>
<p>Driving out fear requires a culture change within the leadership of
the organization.  Eventually, it will minimise the impact of fear on
productivity.   It requires, above all, courage.  Courage to be honest.
Courage to look at problems.  Finally, the courage to attempt to
change.  Driving out fear requires building a psychologically safe
environment.  At the heart of psychological safety are authenticity and
integrity.  Here are a few guidelines to drive out fear:</p>
<h2 id="clarify-the-vision-and-objectives">1. Clarify the vision and
objectives</h2>
<p>When everyone is clear and agrees on the vision of the organization,
conflict can easily be resolved, making it a safe environment to raise
issues.  Shift the focus from perceiving issues as a personal attack on
you as a leader to bullet-proofing the solution in an attempt to reach a
shared goal.</p>
<h2 id="make-information-accessible">2. Make information accessible</h2>
<p>The easiest and most effective way to remove fear is to make
information accessible.  When people have access to information, they
spend less time searching for it or make mistakes as a result of not
having access to it.</p>
<h2 id="clarify-rules-and-expectations-explicitly">3. Clarify rules and
expectations explicitly</h2>
<p>People want to succeed.  They don’t meet expectations because the
rules are unclear or they are not competent yet.  When rules are made
clear explicitly, they will most probably abide by these rules and spend
less time wondering what is expected from them or doing what they think
is expected from them.</p>
<h2 id="be-consistent-in-your-actions">4. Be consistent in your
actions</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest cause of fear is inconsistency in actions by the
leader.  Changing the rules without a clear reason, favoritism, and
elitism are all examples of not being consistent.</p>
<p>Being consistent makes you more predictable and when you are
predictable, the employees can relax enough to spend their <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2015/11/06/are-you-being-recognised-for-your-efforts-at-work/">effort
and time on productive work</a>, not worrying about how you are going to
behave.</p>
<h2 id="be-transparent-and-explain-decisions-explicitly">5. Be
transparent and explain decisions explicitly</h2>
<p><a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/12/11/transparent-leader/">Transparency</a>
is about being open.  Open to receive criticism. Open to listening to
ideas.  Additionally, open to express thoughts and ideas.  People fear a
leader when they don’t know what they are thinking.  Remove any
assumptions or worst case scenarios by expressing what you think about a
given situation or idea in real time.</p>
<p>When you demonstrate that you are open to new ideas, people will feel
safe to raise problems or come to you with ideas to solve a problem.</p>
<h2 id="give-feedback-both-positive-and-negative">6. Give feedback –
both positive and negative</h2>
<p>Many managers want to be liked.  They are there for you when things
go well, but the moment when there is negative feedback to be given or
conflict to be resolved, they walk away.  They <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/05/13/tech-leadership/">outsource</a>
people issues to Human Resources to deal with, or worse, avoid it
totally.</p>
<p>When people know what they are doing right, they will do more of
that.  When they know what they are doing wrong, they will attempt to
change it.  Accurate and constructive feedback is the single biggest
tool to ensure that each step taken is in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledge-your-mistakes">7. Acknowledge your mistakes</h2>
<p>Perfection is a waste.  The more human you are, the more accessible

to also make mistakes.  This reduces the fear of not being perfect.</p>

<h2 id="allow-other-people-to-make-mistakes">8. Allow other people to
make mistakes</h2>
<p>Rather than trying to prevent them from making mistakes, provide a
safe environment where they can fail without the negative consequences
of an unintended mistake.  Focus on the solution and positive intent,
not the problem.  When people feel safe to fail, they are also safe to
innovate and solve problems proactively.</p>
<h2 id="be-fair">9. Be fair</h2>
<p>Listen to both sides of the story before making a judgment.  Make
judgments based on and aligned with the vision and objectives and the
impact on the organization.</p>
<h2 id="demonstrate-integrity">10. Demonstrate integrity</h2>
<p>Say what you do and do what you say.  Always.  <a

demonstrates alignment between your actions and the organizational
vision and goals.  The more aligned you are, the more productive.</p>
<h2 id="fear-is-a-productivity-killer">Fear is a productivity
killer</h2>
<p>The impact of fear on productivity is a silent killer.  It kills
motivation, creativity, and productivity.  To create a productive
environment, drive out fear by making information accessible, being
explicit about expectations and listen without judgment.</p>

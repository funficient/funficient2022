    "description": "A practical guide to ensemble programming (mob programming), explaining why it works, how to get started, and how it improves quality, learning, and team relationships.",
    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<p>Many people think that when they use Scrum, they are an agile
organization. Not wanting to be the bearer of doom, but it couldn’t be
further away from the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agile and Scrum is not the same thing. Scrum is agile, but agile
is not Scrum.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scrum is a prescriptive guidebook containing practices on how to be
more agile. It’s a great set of principles, and in a previous post I
went into a little more detail of <a
href="https://everydayagile.org/why-scrum-works-f74638b13ea5">why Scrum
works</a>, yet, it’s not enough to make you fully agile.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-agile-look-like-then"><em>What does agile look like
then?</em></h2>
<p>In a previous post, I looked at <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/what-does-an-agile-mind-look-like-12f21cb3a20#.y0fz08fjk">what
an agile mind looks like</a>, as the basis of learning how to be more a
more agile organization.</p>
<p>One of the most pertinent reasons Scrum is not going to make you
fully agile, is because it’s not possible to learn how to have a
flexible mindset, by following a prescriptive set of practices of one
methodology.</p>
<p>Like a great chef, the greatness comes only when you know the rules
so well, that you can start breaking them and create your own recipes.
No great chef follows the recipes in a cookbook. Similarly, no truly
agile organization follows one agile method.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For flexibility, you need variety — variety in tools, teams and
methods.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you look at all the more agile companies out there, they mostly
started with Scrum, but soon would follow a more Kanban-like workflow
while reducing the identified waste, borrowed from Lean Manufacturing.
Mostly, there are also some XP practices included in the daily team
activities.</p>
<p>They never stick to only one method. Rather, they tend to understand
the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and know when to apply
which to get the desired results.</p>
<h2 id="just-keep-going">Just keep going…</h2>
<p>Copying is the first part of learning. Following Scrum is a step in
the right direction, but don’t stop there.</p>
<p><em>Keep going.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyday, find better ways to do the same things. Experiment.
Evolve. Change. That’s agile.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agile is a never-ending evolution, not the result of a
transition.</em></p>
</blockquote>

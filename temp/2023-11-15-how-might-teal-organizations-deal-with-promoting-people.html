<p>One of the key differences between organizations primarily operating
from an orange and a teal paradigm is their <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/18/teal-organisational-structure/">organizational
structure</a>, as discussed in more detail in a previous post. The
circular structure of a typical teal organization lacks a hierarchy, and
with that, the need for promotions. This post looks at how appointments
and promoting people are handled in an organization operating primarily
from a teal paradigm. It also provides a rough roadmap to take you from
orange to teal.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-promoting-people">The purpose of promoting
people</h2>
<p>The core intent of promoting people at work is to recognize
leadership skills and experience. When you are promoted essentially your
employer tells you that you have leveled up your skills and are
deserving of more decision-making power. It is typically a token of <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/01/03/trust-in-a-team/">trust</a>
and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/08/11/create-culture-respect/">respect</a>
in the organization.</p>
<p>Titles tell you who you can ask for advice and support. In a typical
pyramid hierarchical organization, a title also indicates who to listen
to when it comes to work assignments. This decreases any overwhelm or
confusion compared to, for example, a matrix model where people report
to many different bosses, sometimes with conflicting priorities.</p>
<p>Although ‘teal’ organizations tend to get rid of any titles, there
are definite advantages to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/07/16/teal-job-titles/">titles</a>.
The main contribution that titles brought to organizational development
is the ability to create an organization that can outlive the leader. 
Before the introduction of roles, an organization’s success depended on
a specific person. When that person was no longer there, the entire
organization dissolved.  It was only when roles were introduced that it
became possible for organizations to outlive a single leader.</p>
<p>As with all things, though, there are both advantages and
disadvantages to titles and promotions, with the biggest shadow side to
promoting people being the reinforcement of a hierarchy and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/15/competition-in-the-workplace/">competition</a>
amongst employees.  Competition, in turn, decreases trust.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadow-side-of-promotions-and-hierarchy">The shadow side of
promotions and hierarchy</h2>
<p>One of the key differences between an ‘orange’ and ‘teal’
organization is that a ‘teal’ organization actively works at getting rid
of any hierarchy and as a consequence, promotions.</p>
<p>But what’s the problem with hierarchies you might ask?</p>
<p>A hierarchy, in essence, destroys the need for <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/10/16/trust-and-control/">trust</a>.
It requires us to obey those in power without question. Sometimes with
dire results. Possibly the most extreme example of the negative impact a
hierarchy can have is seen in the aftermath of the Holocaust.  In an <a
href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-milgram-obedience-experiment-2795243">experiment</a>
attempting to understand why good and respected people in society did
such bad things, authority figures instructed participants to deliver a
painful shock to someone in another room. As much as 65% of people
obeyed, even when they disagreed or refused initially.  Having an
authority figure ask you to do something makes you more likely to obey –
whether it’s in line or goes against your grain.</p>
<p>From the day we are born, we are taught to obey authority figures.
Our survival as a child depended on it. While being obedient to a caring
parent might protect you from harm, blind obedience destroys the
awareness of trust.</p>
<p>If trust is an issue in your organization, thus, try to flatten the
hierarchy.</p>
<p>Another shadow side of hierarchy is that it breaks the emotional
connection between the instruction giver and the impact of the
instruction on its recipients. The boss instructing layoffs in the
workforce, for example, is protected from the impact. They simply make
the decision. Someone else has to act on the decision and inform the
people affected. Essentially, a hierarchy makes it easier to behave
destructively towards the people less powerful than you.</p>
<p>So how do you solve this problem that hierarchy brings to an
organization?</p>
<h2 id="distributing-decision-making">Distributing decision making</h2>
<p>In a boss-less environment, it doesn’t mean there are no bosses.
Rather, everyone is expected to behave like a boss.</p>
<p>This brings up a question worth pondering. When you don’t recognise
employees with a title or a promotion, how do you reward talent,
seniority, and loyalty in an organization? Or, more simply, how do you
know who has more experience than someone else when you’re new to the
organization? How do you know who you can turn to when having to make
decisions?</p>
<p>In a typical ‘orange’ organization, more decision-making power is
granted to those higher up the proverbial food chain. The primary focus
when transitioning to teal is thus to distribute decision-making
power.   That requires a level of responsibility and <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/05/25/teal-leadership/">leadership</a>
qualities in all employees.</p>
<p>Leadership development is thus a crucial aspect of a successful teal
transformation.  But first, let’s look at the characteristics of a
typical ‘orange’ compared to a ‘teal’ organization and how each handles
promotions at work.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-promoting-people-in-orange-organizations">Characteristics
of promoting people in orange organizations</h2>
<p>Organizations operating mainly from an orange paradigm have a pyramid
structure. This structure is maintained by scarce positions and a battle
towards the top. Here are the main characteristics of these
organizations:</p>
<h3 id="intense-competition-for-scarce-promotions">1. Intense
competition for scarce promotions</h3>
<p>In an organization operating primarily from an orange paradigm, there
is intense competition to climb the proverbial corporate ladder. As
positions higher up the ladder become increasingly scares, it often
leads to politics and dysfunctional behavior.</p>
<p>As decision-making power and with that more autonomy – a basic human
need – is linked to promotions, a predatory survival-of-the-fittest
culture tends to form. The most cunning rather than the best leaders are
often promoted, which can lead to all sorts of dysfunctions.</p>
<p>This desire to be promoted can also create corruption, where people
are willing to do anything to get the promotion they so much desire.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-hoarding-in-silos">2. Knowledge hoarding in silos</h3>
<p>As a direct result of the rather intense competition to get promoted,
silos form where the manager has to protect his domain to remain in
control. This leads to information hoarding which in turn leads to an
increase in bureaucracy and ultimately, a decrease in overall
productivity.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-promoting-people-in-teal-organizations">Characteristics
of promoting people in teal organizations</h2>
<p>There is no need for promotions in an organization operating from a
teal paradigm. Essentially, each person is a leader with equal
decision-making power.</p>
<p>With great power, though, comes great responsibility. Leadership
development should thus become the primary focus when transitioning to
teal. Here are the main characteristics of how teal organizations handle
promotions.</p>
<h3 id="rotation-rather-than-promoting-people">1. Rotation rather than
promoting people</h3>
<p>The need for competition is essentially removed from an organization
operating from a teal paradigm. There are no promotions and people have
relative freedom as to which projects they participate in as outlined in
the post on <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/06/02/teal-project-management/">project
management in a teal organization</a>.</p>
<p>Relative, because by being part of a team you have to consider
everyone.  Think back to when you were a small child playing with your
friends. If you behaved destructively or selfishly, your friends didn’t
want to play with you anymore. The same is true for boss-less
organizations. For teams to work well together, you have to play well
together.  Practically, that means you might initiate an advice process
before you volunteer to become involved in a new project.</p>
<h3 id="individual-leadership">2. Individual leadership</h3>
<p>For a boss-less organization to work everyone has to have basic
leadership skills and shared values.  But you can’t expect people who
has been rewarded for being obedient and following orders for years to
be fully autonomous the next.  It is a process to develop <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/04/17/essential-qualities-good-bad-leadership/">leadership
qualities</a>.</p>
<p>To create <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/09/18/autonomous-teams/">autonomous</a>
teams people need to have good communication skills and be team players.
 <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/08/improve-your-judgment/">Judgment</a>
is also a key skill required, together with responsibility.   Being
responsible means no one waits for anyone else to act or decide. When
they see something wrong, they do something about it. Sometimes it might
be taking ownership, at other times it might mean initiating the advice
process.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>Moving from ‘orange’ to ‘teal’ essentially requires an organization
to develop individual leadership. Here is a rough guide to get you from
‘orange’ to ‘teal’ and what such a leadership development strategy might
look like:</p>
<h3 id="develop-leadership-qualities">1. Develop leadership
qualities</h3>
<p>Identify the leadership qualities you deem important in your
organization.  Typically, this might include good communication skills,
good judgment and decision-making, responsibility, ownership, and
integrity.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the qualities, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/04/15/developing-people-5-essentials/">give
people the tools to develop</a> them.  This might be access to courses,
workshops, roles, or projects.  It will also require support on a
personal development journey.</p>
<h3 id="include-a-coaching-strategy">2. Include a coaching strategy</h3>
<p>Coaching is a tool to help people reach their goals and increase
their <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/05/25/self-awareness-workplace/">self-awareness</a>.
A natural consequence of an increase in self-awareness is a higher level
of responsibility.  As the coaching process usually ends in action, it
naturally develops a more proactive attitude. It also models the power
of asking good questions as a means to lead and improve decision-making
and communication skills in the organization.</p>
<p>Decide on a coaching strategy best suited for your organization. 
Maybe you might start with introducing individual coaching to start
with, and later roll out a peer-coaching program for longer-term
sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="visualize-work-and-skills">3. Visualize work and skills</h3>
<p>In a boss-less environment, it can be confusing who to ask for what. 
Transparency in the form of visualizing each person’s skills can solve
this problem.  It can also serve as motivation for people to develop
their skills or seek out a mentor.</p>
<p>For example, you might outline all the key skills required for a
project (or team) to succeed in a skills matrix.  Each team member is
either a beginner, intermediate or advanced at a specific skill.  The
more generic and simple you keep this, the better.  Prevent too much
detail or long lists.  If it doesn’t fit on a page or a whiteboard,
eliminate those skills which are a lower priority.  You can always add
it back when it becomes more pressing to develop this skill.</p>

alt="promoting people" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">promoting people</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When, for example, from the fictional team above, you want to know
something about designs you can easily identify Angela as the best
person to ask. If she’s not available, Chris will be the second best
equipped to answer.</p>
<p>Not everyone will develop, or be interested in developing, all the
skills.  Leave space for individual preferences and imperfection.  It’s
not intended to be a checklist to complete.  It’s a tool to communicate
visually.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-ready-for-teal">Are you ready for teal?</h2>
<p>Promoting people enforces hierarchies, and in an organization
operating primarily from a teal paradigm, there is no place for
hierarchies.  Handling <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/people-development-network/">people
development</a> and recognition for advancement is thus very different
from a traditional ‘orange’ organization.  Ultimately, it requires a
leadership development strategy and a means to recognize an individual’s
talents for others to see.</p>

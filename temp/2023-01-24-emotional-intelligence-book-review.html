<h1 class="title">Emotional Intelligence Book Review</h1>
<p class="author">Kate Dames</p>

<p><em>A scientific and practical look at emotional intelligence and why
it may be more important than IQ. The book looks at the physiological
details of emotions and why they exist, as well as a breakdown of the
components of emotional intelligence and practical tools to increase
your own emotional intelligence.</em></p>
<h1 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h1>
<p>I would recommend this book to everyone. Whether or not you are
struggling to regulate your emotions, you are bound to come across
challenging situations where others are not able to regulate their
emotions well, making this book a great toolkit to understand yourself
as well as others. If you struggle with loneliness or wanting social
acceptance, this is an invaluable read.</p>
<p>It is also exceptionally useful for anyone thinking about moving into
a leadership position or becoming an entrepreneur.</p>
<h1 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h1>
<p>The book starts off explaining the physiology of emotions and how the
brain process and access emotions scientifically.</p>
<p>The author argues that emotions are crucial for effective thought and
how it can disrupt (or aid) learning. He also outlines how a lack of
control on your emotional life, regardless of your intellect, can result
in academic failure, alcoholism, and criminality. In fact, he argues
that IQ contributes as little as 20% of life success, with the remaining
80% as a result of emotional intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Intellect cannot work at its best without emotional intelligence.” —
Daniel Goleman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When there is a disconnect between your mind / thoughts and emotions
/ heart, it causes a lack of emotional control which results in bad
decisions. Emotional intelligence is also the key to influence and
negotiation rather than intellectual intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="five-domains-of-emotional-intelligence">Five domains of
emotional intelligence</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Knowing your emotions</strong> forms the foundation of
emotional intelligence. The first step in increasing your emotional
intelligence is thus to recognize and articulate feelings as it
happens.</li>
<li><strong>Managing emotions</strong> is the next step to emotional
intelligence. It is the ability to pause before reacting and consider
options and the consequences of each before choosing the best
option.</li>
<li>Another key to emotional intelligence relates to
<strong>self-motivation</strong>. Being able to stifle impulses and
delay gratification, is a key factor of success in life.</li>
<li>Once you have mastered emotions in yourself, the next level of
emotional intelligence asks you to <strong>recognize emotions in
others</strong> through being attuned to them.</li>
<li>Finally, the ability to <strong>manage emotions in others</strong>
marks the final domain of emotional intelligence. Being able to handle
relationships and maintain harmony in a group greatly improves your
influence and success in life.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-social-arts">The social arts</h2>
<p>Part of the book takes an in-depth look at what the author calls the
social arts.</p>
<p>It outlines how the ability to read emotions in others and respond
accordingly is the primary indicator of <strong>popularity</strong> in
groups. It then identify why people tend to reject some people and a
strategy for social acceptance, briefly summarized as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Observe without acting.</li>
<li>Mimic, or mirroring, which builds rapport.</li>
<li>Only then join and participate in activities or conversation.</li>
<li>Check-in with others before answering by asking what they
think.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also outlines a guide for giving critique in an emotional
intelligent way, and the ingredients for a good relationship.</p>
<h2 id="checklist-for-emotional-regulation">Checklist for emotional
regulation</h2>
<p>It ends with more practical tools and tips on how to school the
emotions, including a checklist to use when you get triggered
emotionally which I love so much I created a little (adapted) checklist
for myself. Download a pdf version to print out <strong><a

<p><img

<p>There is much more in the book, but this should give you an idea of
how practical the contents are.</p>
<h1 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h1>
<p>The book is an easy and interesting read, written in a conversational
style filled with stories and case studies. I really like the scientific
evidence and research included.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-author">About the author</h1>
<p><strong>Daniel Goleman Ph.D.</strong> has taught at Harvard and
writes on the behavioral and brain sciences for <em>The New York
Times</em>. He was also the senior editor at <em>Psychology Today</em>
and have authored a number of other books.</p>
<p><strong><em>Find the book <a

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Emotional Intelligence makes the case for why emotions are a
fundamental tool for success and possibly more important than IQ. It
contains science backed evidence of emotional development and how
emotional intelligence can increase your popularity as well as your
success in business and relationships in general.</p>
<p>A highly recommended read for anyone interested in having better
relationships — whether at work or at home.</p>

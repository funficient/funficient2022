<h1 class="title">The A-B-C’s of Team Alignment</h1>

<p>It’s the end of the year, after 4 pm in the afternoon and the project
is winding down.  We’re sitting outside drinking a glass of wine,
discussing the successes and failures of the past year in an informal
retrospective. “Why, if we have such good developers with so much
experience, are we struggling so much?  Why do we seem incapable of
producing this kind of project?”  The question comes with honest
curiosity.  An inability to comprehend the equivalent of why bad things
happen to good people. Little do they realise the problem stems from a
lack of team alignment.</p>
<p>I don’t have the courage to give my honest opinion – namely <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/09/29/leadership-ego/">too
much ego</a> – knowing they will not receive it well.  I cowardly
refrain from naming the elephant in the room and focus on the less
vulnerable aspects of the project.</p>
<p>I’ve only been there a few months and only worked on this one
project, but the pattern that emerges after numerous conversations about
other projects in the company is clear.  Awesome, skilled and
experienced developers building relatively easy projects.  Not exactly
rocket science, yet, what should take hours carry on for weeks.  As the
timelines shorten while the to-dos grow, the customer becomes
increasingly unhappy.</p>
<p>Everyone in the team is just so <em>nice</em> and trying so hard.
 They’re doing the best they can.  I don’t want to hold up the mirror
for them to see their dysfunction any more or any earlier than what is
necessary.  They’ve already made paradigm shifts in behavior since I
started. It’s time to focus on successes, <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/07/23/failure-is-an-attempt-at-success/">not
failures</a> if they’re to finish this project successfully.</p>
<p>So I keep quiet, knowing they won’t be able to hear me just yet, but
here is the advice I would offer.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason-for-failure">The reason for failure</h2>
<p>Companies and teams don’t fail because they have ‘bad’ or unskilled
people working there.  Companies and teams also don’t fail because they
have a lack of resources, or they have an inferior product, or because
they don’t have good customers. They fail because they lack team
alignment.</p>
<p>Rewind three months.</p>
<p>I walk into a team with a team lead – a very clever and talented
architect who is unable to communicate his vision or message to the
team, rendering his knowledge mostly useless; the engineering lead,
technically very talented and exceptionally likeable but used to working
on small 1 – 3 man projects and not used to leading large teams; and
some of the most experienced developers in the company with technical
capabilities that most companies would be envious of.  Technical talent
in abundance.</p>
<p>The project, however, is struggling badly. It literally feels as if
development is coming to a grinding halt, even though the team is
working overtime most days to try and catch up on a growing backlog.
 Each time one piece of code is merged to add a new feature, ten or more
new issues arise, often introducing regression to features that
previously worked.</p>
<p>One step forward, ten steps back.</p>
<p><em>So why, with all this technical talent, is the project not
progressing as planned?</em></p>
<p>The answer is simple, yet an inconvenient truth.  Too many people
thinking they know what they’re doing and don’t think they need a leader
or coach.  In other words, a team of people all pulling in different
directions with their own preferences and priorities, disregarding the
project goals and priorities. Each person works on what <em>they</em>
think is most important or right. No-one willing to compromise, feeling
their solution is the better one.  Even if they say they do.</p>
<h2 id="the-a-b-c-of-team-success">The A-B-C of team success</h2>
<p>For a team to succeed there needs to be three foundational things in
place.  It’s not enough to be technically skilled alone.  It’s more
important to contribute to the <em>team’s</em> success than to be clever
or talented.</p>
<p>Here are the three fundamental requirements for team alignment and
success:</p>
<h3 id="a-is-for-awareness">A is for Awareness</h3>
<p>Essentially, when all the team members work towards the same goal at
the same time, they are aligned.  With awareness of what the vision is,
people can support each other to achieve their mutual goal.</p>
<p>Easier said than done.</p>
<p>How do you get a bunch of intelligent, independent adults pulling in
the same direction?  How do you align a team when they don’t think they
need help?</p>
<p>Awareness is the first step to any form of <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2020/09/23/teams-dont-change/">change
and it is no different to achieve team</a> alignment.  The first aspect
of team alignment is to know what your ultimate goal is and that it
requires a <em>whole</em> team to deliver.  A <em>great</em> developer
is good.  A <em>good</em> developer <strong><em>and</em></strong> a
<em>good</em> tester <strong><em>and</em></strong> a <em>good</em>
designer are ten times better!</p>
<p>It’s important for people to realize they are one part in a bigger
engine, all equally important. One person is never better than the
other.  One skill not more valuable than the next.  Each person is as
necessary as the next to produce a complete product.</p>
<p>Each person in the team is unique and brings a unique perspective to
the team. Or as <strong>Marie Forleo</strong> would put it, that special
gift that only <em>you</em> have.  In a team setting it is important for
teams to be aware of their own and their team’s strengths and weaknesses
as it is important to be clear on the vision.</p>
<h3 id="b-is-for-boundaries">B is for Boundaries</h3>
<p>Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of a team is as important as
explicitly setting clear boundaries. It is often the lack of boundaries
that causes issues.  It results in different people working on the same
piece of code, or one person implementing a design in one way while
someone else implements it in a different way, resulting in a conflict
between the two solutions, rendering both error-prone or even
useless.</p>
<p>Who is responsible for deciding on the priorities?  Who is
responsible for deciding how the design should look like and what it
should do?  Also, who is responsible for deciding on the architecture?
 Who is responsible for making it look awesome?</p>
<p>In a restaurant, the waiters stay out of the kitchen and the chef
stay off the floor.  It’s both a sign of respect and efficient.  When
everyone knows what’s expected from them and who to ask when a problem
arises, they can focus on building their puzzle piece.</p>
<p>Even if you’re good at more than one part of the workflow, if someone
else is the team elected responsible person for that specific area, put
your own wants aside and respect the team roles.</p>
<h3 id="c-is-for-conversations">C is for Conversations</h3>
<p>Finally, and most importantly to align teams, is the need for regular
conversations.  Even when there are no boundaries or awareness, having
conversations will eventually and inevitably uncover and resolve it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversation is the medicine for team culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s in the conversations that people get to know each other.  It’s
in the conversations that they gain more insight into the other’s
perspectives.  It is in the conversations that problems are solved and
goals achieved.</p>
<p>If you want to change the culture, you have to change the
conversations*.</p>
<p>For example, when the leader uses “we” when he wants someone to take
ownership when assigning work, probably no-one will act. Change the “we”
to “you” or even better “who?” and see how no action quickly transforms
into action and a culture of responsibility.</p>
<p><em>One word.</em>  That’s all it takes to change a culture.</p>
<p>Similarly, when conversations are focused around the problem, the
culture is probably one of blame.  Change the conversations to focus on
solutions and the culture transforms into a problem solving one.</p>
<p>The two most crucial tools to transform cultures using conversation
are firstly to have regular, short, face-to-face conversations and
secondly, to rephrase issues into questions.  Rather than saying “We
have this big problem”, ask “How might we resolve this problem?” or “Who
else has had this problem and how did they resolve it?”.  Rather than
saying “We need to build this next”, try “Who can build this?”</p>
<h2 id="teachings-from-africa">Teachings from Africa</h2>
<p>The western world is only now discovering the value of conversations,
with <a href="https://b-m-institute.com/bushe-marshak-articles/">Robert
Marshak’s dialogic organizational development</a> and talk therapy
becoming increasingly popular.  African culture has always known
this.</p>
<p>African culture focuses on <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/01/22/relationships/">relationships
first.</a>  It is considered rude to jump straight to the point in the
conversation.  Ideally, first, you eat together and talk about the
weather and family and other seemingly insignificant things before you
engage in a business transaction.  Typically, a 2-hour meeting will take
a whole day, with the majority of the time spent on building
relationships.</p>
<p>I initially met this business culture with resistance.  How could it
<em>possibly</em> be more productive to waste a whole day for just one
project meeting?</p>
<p>The majority of larger organizations I’ve worked for (and which
shaped my earlier thinking) encourage people to limit the conversations
and focus on doing the work.  Conversations are kept for meetings and
personal life is totally excluded from these meetings.  It’s considered
unprofessional to talk about your personal life in a business
meeting.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-conversations-in-aligning-teams">The
importance of conversations in aligning teams</h2>
<p>Yet, the most successful project I’ve worked on was one where we
mixed business and pleasure.  In fact, a seemingly impossible project
turned into the flagship product for a large international group, based
on informal conversations for half of the day.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize how important those conversations were in our
success until much later.  At the time, the manager (and company as a
whole) was not interested in the project and believed it would fail. 
They left us to do our own thing while they focused on the more
important projects.  No-one told us how to communicate or what to talk
about.</p>
<p>We ended up chatting about random things and making jokes for most of
the day, spending far fewer hours working than chatting.  A few months
later we shipped and the product was so successful that it became the
flagship product for the group.</p>
<p>What we didn’t realize at the time was how important these
conversations were in strengthening our relationships.  These
conversations helped us understand each other and our diverse cultures
better.  It made us like each other much more, which meant we wanted to
help each other succeed. It helped us work on the same thing and fixing
one problem at a time.</p>
<p>So next time when you’re struggling with team alignment, try spending
more time on building relationships and have more conversations.  Raise
the awareness towards what you want to achieve and how, and clarify
boundaries.</p>
<p><em>Conversations matter.</em>  </p>

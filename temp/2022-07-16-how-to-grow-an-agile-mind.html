    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

Get better answers.</h2>
<p>The Scrum Guide teaches the tools of the trade. How to plan, estimate
and organize your teams. Which ceremonies to run and how to facilitate
them. Yet, many teams adapt these ceremonies without ever adapting the
agile mindset. <em>Why is that?</em></p>
<p><em>And more importantly, how do you learn how to
<strong>think</strong> more agile?</em></p>
<h1 id="the-case-for-an-agile-mindset">The case for an agile
mindset</h1>
<p><em>Agility doesn’t have anything to do with Scrum, the Agile
Manifesto or XP (or any other tool or process for that matter). Although
Scrum is an inherently agile process, you don’t need Scrum to be
agile.</em> Similarly, the Agile Manifesto is a bunch of values and
principles. It’s a guide that helps you become more agile. Following
these principles doesn’t, however, <em>guarantee</em> that you will grow
an agile mindset. XP, in my opinion, is the closest set of tools to grow
agility, yet, it still doesn’t <strong><em>guarantee</em></strong>
agility.</p>
<p>Essentially you only need two things to <em>guarantee</em> agile
thinking, rather than merely <em>doing</em> agile (and learning the
Scrum Guide or Agile Manifesto isn’t one of them). To
<strong><em>think</em></strong> agile — first of all you need an
<strong><em>extreme ability to learn</em></strong>. You need to ask more
questions. And you need to ask <em>better</em> questions. Second, you
need to be comfortable with <strong><em>change and
failing</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agile mind is a mind that is able to learn <em>and</em> use new
information effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-paradox-of-mind">The paradox of mind</h1>
<p>I’m interested in how the mind works. Always have been. <em>Not</em>
thinking hurts my brain.</p>
<p>Questions I typically ask include: How do we remember things? What
exactly is memory? How do we learn? How do we come up with new ideas?
How do we think? How can we think <em>better</em>?</p>
<p><em>What I discovered is that our mind is a paradox. And that paradox
is the key to an agile mind.</em></p>
<p>We all know about the left-logical and right-creative sides of the
brain. However, there seems to be a different, unexplored dimension of
the brain (or maybe it has already been explored and I just haven’t
discovered it yet) separating the inside (unconscious) and outside
(conscious) sides of the brain. Or, to simplify for illustrative
purposes and compared to the well known ice-berg metaphor, splitting the
top of the ice-berg or consciously used brain and the bottom, unknown
and mostly unused part of the ice-berg or brain.</p>
<p><img

<p>Image by <a href="http://www.funficient.club">funficient</a></p>
<p>On the one (unconscious) side, it’s built for optimization, learning
from past experiences. It allows us to do or recognize things without
even thinking about it. We can cross the street or drive to work without
<em>consciously</em> thinking about it. We can recognize an object like
a coin without being able to recall the details. Yet, we can tell
immediately if it’s one currency or another.</p>
<p>Go ahead and try it yourself. Try to draw the coin you most
frequently use. Can you remember what objects and images and shapes are
on the coin or note?</p>
<p>If you’re still not convinced, I highly recommend reading <a
href="https://www.charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/">The Power of
Habit</a> by Charles Duhigg, a more in-depth look at how habit helps you
achieve success, and also how powerful repetition is.</p>
<p>On the other — opposite — side, the mind is built to learn new things
more consciously. This part of the brain is wired to create and plan for
the future, experience new things, and search for novelty. This is the
part responsible for innovation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this part of the brain is also linked to happiness. In
his research on how the mind works Edward de Bono discovered (without it
being the subject of his research) that insight (aka becoming aware of
new information) or learning is always linked to spontaneous
laughter.</p>
<p>It turns out that discovering or learning something new makes us
happy. Dreaming about the future or making plans for an event that
hasn’t yet occurred, brings us joy. It’s a different kind of thinking to
the thinking we use to recognize a coin or cross the street.</p>
<p>An agile mind is a mind that is <em>fully</em> used — all four
quadrants of it. A mind that explores the unknown future as much as it
remembers the past. One that follows procedures and rules as much as it
creates new ideas and try out new things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An agile mind is a whole mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how do you learn how to <em>think</em> agile?</p>
<h1 id="become-an-extreme-learner">1. Become an extreme learner</h1>
<p>The more tools in your tool-set, the more efficient and effective you
can apply the right tool to solve the right problem at the right time.
It allows you to be more agile.</p>
<p>If you <em>only</em> use TDD (test driven development) to verify
code, or <em>only</em> play planning poker to estimate, or <em>only</em>
use Jira for task management, or <em>always</em> follow the same process
to anything, you’re not agile.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/896/1*L5FsNR9sj4c9RvFzVW2RjQ.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The Caterpillar from wikipedia.org</p>
<p>In fact, whenever you answer <em>‘Always’</em> or <em>‘Only’</em>
when asked how to do anything, you’ve failed the agility test. You’re
agile when you can <em>easily</em> think of <strong><em>and
use</em></strong> at least 3–5 methods to solve a specific problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before
breakfast.” — Alice in Wonderland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To become an agile thinker, learn <em>everything</em>. Read up on
topics that will make you a better designer, developer, tester, product
owner… Go to conferences and meetups. Read books, listen to podcasts,
subscribe to blogs of people that inspire you.</p>
<p><em>But don’t stop there.</em> Also learn about things that scares
you. If you’re a business owner, learn how to code. If you’re a
programmer, learn more about design.</p>
<p><em>But don’t stop there either.</em> Learn about fields that aren’t
directly related to your domain or anything for that matter. Learning
how to make soap was probably one of the most profound (and insightful)
learning experiences I’ve ever had. I knew nothing about it and science
was my worst subject at school as I simply wasn’t interested in it.
Soap, however, is all about science and understanding the properties of
each oil and getting the ratios between the different properties right.
It taught me to trust, to have an open mind and to experiment (and
fail).</p>
<p>Learn how to cook a cuisine you’re not familiar with, or how to be a
beekeeper or a barista. Above all, learn a new language. Learning a new
skill is relatively easy as someone has already figured out exactly how
it works and how to learn it. Learning a new language, though, is much
more complex. Language requires you to learn the rules (grammar), the
sounds, the vocabulary, and the structures like most other new topics.
But it also requires you to understand the culture — the
<em>unwritten</em> rules that most people don’t even realize exist.
Those slang words only used by the locals, the intonations that
distinguishes the moods and emotions. The body language and
gestures.</p>
<h2 id="the-antidote-to-arrogance">The antidote to arrogance</h2>
<p>Many people tend to specialize in a single field or industry. And
most recruiters evaluate seniority with the amount of time spent
applying one skill, further shaping this trend. They are a C# or Java
developer. They are a Product Owner in the financial industry.</p>
<p>Inevitably, however, specializing in any field tends to make you
arrogant because you tend to know all the answers pertaining to your
subject field. If you think everyone you work with is an idiot, and you
never make mistakes, you might want to re-evaluate.</p>

<p><a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/5-steps-towards-mastery-in-learning-4822d61cb36f">5
Steps Towards Mastery in Learning</a></p>
<p>Learning new things help you realize how little you know and how much
there is to learn. It opens you up to possibilities. To think in new
ways. It helps you question things more, which helps you innovate and
improve more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you aren’t truly tool or language agnostic, you’re not
agile.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An agile mind can pick up any tool or language within hours. An agile
mind has <strong><em>mastered how to learn</em></strong>, not merely
learning one thing.</p>
<p>For more on how I experience the process of learning, read <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/5-steps-towards-mastery-in-learning-4822d61cb36f">The
5 Steps Towards Mastery in Learning</a>. The training course serves
mostly as a tool to raise awareness of what you don’t know yet. The
<em>real</em> learning only starts when you apply the learned skills in
<em>different</em> situations and mastery usually follows a period of
rest or letting go.</p>
<h1 id="be-comfortable-with-failure-and-change">2. Be comfortable with
failure and change</h1>
<p>The second part of growing an agile mindset is probably even more
important than the first, mostly because society has taught us to
believe failure is a bad thing so we tend to avoid it at all cost.</p>
<p>Most people don’t like to fail. They don’t like change either, as it
slows them down and risks possible failure. However, agility is
ultimately a change methodology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agility is your ability as organization to sense and respond to
changes quickly enough to enable you to remain competitive and
profitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when you change the way you’ve done things in the past, you’re
bound to make mistakes. Even if you don’t make any mistakes, the change
might uncover a mistake in a different part of the system that was
previously hidden.</p>
<p>An agile mind is a flexible, curious, ever-learning mind. The
opposite of rigid and habit-driven. Inherently that requires you to be
willing to fail.</p>
<p>To become more comfortable with failure, start by opening yourself up
to the possibility that you could be wrong. Look for how other people
are right when you’re in discussion with them, rather than focusing your
attention on finding proof for how you are right, or how they are
wrong.</p>
<p>Practice making mistakes in a more playful environment. Dedicate a
story to experiment with a new technology in a sandbox or code branch
that won’t affect the live code. Or spend your slack time (or did you
forget those exist?) testing out a new skill.</p>
<p>When you do make a mistake, share your failure. Admit you were wrong
and if it affected other people, apologize. Go ahead and try it. It’s
extremely liberating to apologize for your mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="play-more">Play more</h2>
<p>Children are masters in learning. They also spend most of their time
playing. Where a game is a framework for learning, play is a framework
for exploring and experimenting. It’s a forgiving space where you can
make mistakes without the consequences of real life.</p>
<p>Spend more time playing to get accustomed to being wrong. Join
associations like the ToastMasters to practice a skill in front of
people that you’re not comfortable with, with permission to receive
feedback on areas that need improvement.</p>
<p>By far the most useful tool I’ve found to become more vulnerable and
open to failure, is booking coaching or counseling (even if you think
you don’t need it) with someone you trust. It’s a safe space where you
are able to share your issues without judgement. It teaches you to share
your failures and receive feedback, but without the risks associated
with doing the same at work. Once you’ve done this enough, it becomes
more natural. It also teaches you to open up to different possibilities
and a good coach will hold you accountable to try new behaviors, making
you more comfortable with change.</p>

<h1 class="title">What might compensation in a teal organization look
like?</h1>

<p>Compensation in the context of the modern workplace essentially
relates to the exchange of value between an individual and an
organization. Typically, the company pays employees in return for
services rendered. More specialized or scarce services are typically
more expensive.  More abundant services typically result in lower rates.
This post, as part of the Teal Series, looks at what compensation might
look like in an organization operating mainly from a teal paradigm.</p>
<p><em>Is money the only means to exchange value? How do you handle
compensation in a bossless environment?</em> <em>How do you transition
from orange to teal when it comes to handling salaries?</em></p>
<p>These are some of the questions this post aims to answer. But first,
let’s look at a metaphor to view compensation from the perspective of
consciousness compared to toxic capitalism.</p>
<h2 id="growing-the-good">Growing the good</h2>
<p>From a conscious capitalistic view, we might compare compensation
with a caring apple farmer. The conscious capitalistic farmer loves
growing apples. He finds joy in every part of the process and delights
in every apple harvested.  He ensures a thriving ecosystem. The farmer
makes sure there’s adequate compost with all the nutrients to yield
healthy soil.  He also complements the trees with companion plants which
attracts insects and birds which in turn adds to the pollination and
soil quality in a virtuous circle.</p>
<p>The majority of the apples are sold for a profit, but he also saves
some for a future harvest. He understands the interconnectedness of the
ecosystem and the importance of insects, birds, and all the other plants
and animals. Although his apples aren’t all perfect, they are nutritious
and delicious.  The conscious farmer’s primary goal is
sustainability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a greedy farmer with a toxic capitalistic view
prioritizes short-term profit. He sells all the apples at maximum profit
while reinvesting the bare minimum back into the ecosystem’s health. His
goal is to grow the biggest apples at the lowest cost.  Each year the
quality of the soil decreases as it is sprayed with chemicals to kill
everything that prohibits the growth of the perfect apple. The insects,
birds, and other life gradually disappear resulting in fruit that looks
delicious but lacks the nutrients. The soil gets depleted each year
until it is depleted, rendering it useless. By this time the farmer
retires. He is unaware of the impact his greediness had on the ecosystem
or the ability to grow apples in the future. The toxic farmer’s primary
goal is short-term profit.</p>
<h2 id="conscious-vs.-toxic-capitalism">Conscious vs. toxic
capitalism</h2>
<p>Similarly, organizations can operate primarily in a toxic or
conscious capitalistic way. The toxic capitalist organization
prioritizes profit over employee well-being, primarily interested in
short-term gains. They will pay employees as little as possible to
maximize their benefits. When the company is in trouble, they don’t
think twice to lay off employees to ensure their profits remain intact. 
Burned-out employees who are put under constant stress are simply
replaced with someone younger, stronger, and possibly cheaper.</p>
<p>The conscious capitalist organization, on the other hand, prioritizes
employee well-being over short-term profits. They are in it for the long
haul. Where necessary they make short-term profit sacrifices in favour
of long-term gains, much like Warren Buffet approached his investments
over time.</p>
<p>They prioritize a work environment and actively consider and care for
employees’ mental, physical, and emotional health, thus extending the
lifetime value of each employee. They understand the importance of
keeping the people they’ve already invested in over finding cheaper
replacements.  They’ve seen the compound effect of having employees grow
with the company over the years.</p>
<h2 id="needs-and-compensation">Needs and compensation</h2>
<p>The conscious capitalist organization views compensation as more than
money. They view it as an equal exchange with a goal for both employer
and employee to thrive.</p>
<p>Ultimately, compensation is the tool to create a positive reinforcing
loop in the bigger system of the organization. When employee’s basic
salaries are adequate, they are motivated to work hard, leading to
higher quality products and services, leading to more profit, which
ultimately allows the organization to compensate workers even
better.</p>
<p><em>But is money the only means of compensating employees?</em></p>
<h3 id="the-6-basic-needs">The 6 Basic Needs</h3>
<p>While money is a convenient token for exchanging value to meet
employees’ needs, it is not the only means of compensation. According to
Dr. John Schindler, the core human needs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>love</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>creative expression</li>
<li>recognition</li>
<li>new experiences</li>
<li>self-esteem</li>
</ul>
<p>Money satisfies the need for security, while a promotion might
satisfy the need for self-esteem. There is, however, also the need for
love, creative expression, new experiences and recognition.</p>
<p>What if compensation could find a way of meeting more human needs?
And what if you could allow employees to have new experiences,
recognition, and creative expression within the work environment? What
if money <em>wasn’t</em> the only currency?</p>
<p>When the goal of compensation is to ensure the sustainable well-being
of both employee and employer, many options become possible.  But first,
let’s look at the difference between the <a
href="https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/theory/compensation-and-incentives/">primary
characteristics of a typical ‘orange’ and ‘teal’ organization</a>.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-orange-compensation">Characteristics of
‘orange’ compensation</h2>
<p>Organizations operating mainly from an orange paradigm reward
individuals based on a hierarchy. There also tend to be vast differences
between bottom and top earners within an organization.</p>
<p>Here are the main characteristics of these organizations:</p>
<h3 id="individual-incentives">1. Individual incentives</h3>
<p>Orange organizations focus heavily on individuals – both when it
comes to measuring <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2023/08/27/teal-performance-management/">performance</a>
and awarding bonuses and salary increases. Individuals who meet or
exceed their set targets get rewarded with large monetary bonuses.</p>
<h3 id="superior-decides-compensation">2. Superior decides
compensation</h3>
<p>Another key characteristic of compensation within organizations
primarily operating from an orange paradigm is that the immediate line
manager within the hierarchical system often decides on salary
increases.</p>
<p>Often, people fall into salary bands and the line manager has the
freedom to increase someone’s salary as long as it falls within these
predefined bands.</p>
<h3 id="meritocratic-principles-can-lead-to-large-salary-differences">3.
Meritocratic principles can lead to large salary differences</h3>
<p>Finally, an organization operating mainly from an orange paradigm
tends to have large differences between the top and bottom earners. As
individual achievement is ingrained in this paradigm, top performers are
rewarded, leaving average to lower performers essentially penalized for
being average.  This leads to immense <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2021/01/15/competition-in-the-workplace/">competition</a>
in the workplace.</p>
<p>Blue and white-collar workers tend to have a large difference in how
much they get paid, which categorizes them into different classes.  They
also get paid based on different terms to further emphasize the
hierarchy.  The salaried workers get paid monthly regardless of hours
worked with certain benefits, while the blue-collar workers get paid
hourly with no benefits.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-teal-compensation">Characteristics of ‘teal’
compensation</h2>
<p>The primary difference in how compensation is handled in a primarily
orange and teal paradigm relates to the variance between top and bottom
earners in the company. A predominantly teal organization aims for more
equity with the top 3 characteristics of a teal organization listed
below.</p>
<h3 id="self-set-salaries-with-peer-calibration-for-base-pay">1.
Self-set salaries with peer calibration for base pay</h3>
<p>In an organization operating from a mainly teal paradigm, there are
no bosses. It is a self-managed system with full <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/07/22/autonomy-increase-productivity/">autonomy</a>.
Peers decide on salaries, either in a peer-review process where
colleagues rate an individual’s performance or an advice-based process
where the individuals propose their salary.</p>
<p>When salaries are self-set, they also typically initiate the advice
process.  Peers verify that the set salary is reasonable and fair and
challenge it when needed.</p>
<h3 id="no-bonus-but-equal-profit-sharing">2. No bonus, but equal profit
sharing</h3>
<p>As the focus is more on the team than individuals, bonuses are not
commonly seen in ‘teal’ organizations. All employees and stakeholders
share in the profits.</p>
<p>As a form of manual <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/05/25/the-best-examples-of-daos-everyone-should-know-about/?sh=47a56f6340c3">DAO</a>
(decentralized autonomous organization), everyone entitled to a profit
share participates in making decisions related to profit distribution. 
If you’re not familiar with a DAO, it is a form of legal structure,
popular in the blockchain ecosystem, that has no governing body. 
Decisions are managed in a bottom-up approach where each participant or
user gets tokens they can use to vote.  The more you contribute to a
system, the more voting tokens you get.</p>
<p>Before a project (or organization) starts the founders decide on the
rules of engagement. For example, maybe you decide that 20% of the
profit goes towards operational costs, while the rest is equally
distributed by all the contributors.</p>
<h3 id="narrower-salary-differences">3. Narrower salary differences</h3>
<p>Finally, a predominantly teal organization has a much narrower
difference between employees’ salaries. The top and bottom earners in
the organization are much closer than in a typical orange organization
where the top earner can earn millions while the bottom earner struggles
with minimum wages.</p>
<p>Some organizations also eliminate the difference between <em>how</em>
people are paid entirely in an attempt to remove the hierarchy. 
Everyone gets treated the same. Hourly workers, for example, become
salaried employees.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve outlined the major differences between an orange and
teal organization, how do you move from one to another?</p>
<p>Moving from orange to teal when it comes to compensation might be a
decision you want to take slowly.  Although I’ve only heard successes
around opening up the books, salaries remain a sensitive topic.  Here is
a rough guide as a suggestion to get you to teal:</p>
<h3 id="decide-on-an-economic-model">1. Decide on an economic model</h3>
<p>Money is a sensitive matter, especially when there is a vast
difference between top and bottom earners. Before you take any steps
that can’t be reversed,  preferably spend time to agree on the
underlying, strategic economic model.</p>
<p>How do you plan to distribute profits? How will you ensure fairness?
What will the currency or currencies of compensation be? Will you, for
example, allow benefits like extra leave, time for volunteering, travel
perks, or forms of recognition to satisfy human basic needs? How will
you handle the transformation?</p>
<p><a href="https://dna.crisp.se/docs/economic-model.html">Crisp</a>, an
agile coaching consulting company has defined, for example, a model
where each consultant pays a “tax” based on their income. This “tax”
pays for shared services in this decentralized organization. They also
allocate a percentage of their profits to a risk pool.</p>
<p>The first step is to decide on an economic model on a strategic
level.  Ensure, on a high level, that the best interest of the company –
and its purpose – is taken into consideration rather than the best
interest of certain individuals.</p>
<h3 id="make-salaries-transparent">2. Make salaries transparent</h3>
<p>The next step is to open up the books. Make salaries transparent for
everyone to see. Some companies do this internally, while others make
the information available to the public.</p>
<p>Opening up the books might result in some surprises. Maybe you
assumed a boss or senior gets paid a lot more. Or maybe you discover
someone junior is paid more than you thought fair. Expect some
discomfort as people process the contents and create space for
conversations around the salaries.</p>
<p>Talk about the elephant in the room.</p>
<h3 id="agree-on-a-salary-review-process">3. Agree on a salary review
process</h3>
<p>The final step is to agree on a salary review process and then start
using it. Who will review salaries? What if there’s a conflict or
disagreement? What if there’s a big difference between what one person
is paid and the next?</p>
<p>Will you use the peer-set or self-set salary approach? Or maybe you
choose a combination of the two, allowing both peers and individuals to
recommend a salary and then find a middle way? Will the review be done
by randomly assigned peers and customers? Or will the person volunteer
people to review their salary?</p>
<p>Here is how <a
href="https://medium.com/@josephlphillips/working-like-grown-ups-defusing-salary-sensitivity-with-the-power-of-peer-pay-5f5d6bb5a39d">Everoze</a>,
a values-driven renewables company, transitioned to a peer-pay review
system.</p>
<p>Once you’ve implemented the process, intentionally include space for
adapting it regularly going forward.  You’re bound to have missed some
edge cases or scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-ready-for-teal">Are you ready for teal?</h2>
<p>Compensation is the exchange for value between employer and
employee.  When there are large discrepancies between top and bottom
earners, an imbalance in the system arises.   When employees, for
example, feel unfairly treated when it comes to compensation they might
tend to put less effort into their work.  This, in turn, leads to lower
quality products or services which might decrease your profit, which in
turn will mean you have to cut salaries even more, creating a
destructive cycle.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a more teal way of operation doesn’t have to result
in chaos.  The question is whether the pain of staying where you are is
bigger than the pain of trying something new.  If you missed the

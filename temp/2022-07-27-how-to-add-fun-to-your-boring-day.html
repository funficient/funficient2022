<p>So you’ve taken the leap and broke free from the group and started
your own business. You wanted to have more fun. More freedom. More
control.</p>
<p>And yet, here you are, king of your own little (or big) castle (or
two or three or ten) and still there’s something missing. The excitement
of the startup has faded into boring daily routine. Each day seems to be
predictably similar to the previous one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Loneliness</em></strong> sets in, even though you’re
surrounded by people. <strong><em>Boredom</em></strong> constantly
knocks on your door, even though each day you work hard to avoid it by
being as busy as possible. You start a new project. Take on a new
client. Make a new friend. Hoping <strong><em>Boredom</em></strong> will
leave. But it doesn’t. Even ‘new’-ness has become boringly predictable.
Then <strong><em>Anger</em></strong> comes to visit and refuses to
leave. It chases away some old acquaintances but you invite them back,
apologetically. Then <strong><em>Blame</em></strong> pops in for a cup
of tea and <strong><em>Shame</em></strong> and
<strong><em>Despair</em></strong> shows their face briefly before hiding
away again. Each time there’s a knock on your door you expectantly hope
that it’s <strong><em>Joy</em></strong> or
<strong><em>Happiness</em></strong> coming to visit, but it’s
<strong>Depression</strong> and <strong>Disappointment</strong>.</p>
<p><em>What now? How do you introduce some fun into your boring daily
routine? How do you invite <strong>Joy</strong> and
<strong>Happiness</strong> to become your friends?</em></p>
<p>There’s a saying that you can either give a hungry person a fish and
feed them for a day. Or you can teach them how to fish. This post
attempts to give both. First, teaching you how to fish, secondly, some
concrete examples you can try out immediately.</p>
<h1 id="knowledge-is-power">Knowledge is power</h1>
<p>To transform boring into fun there are 3 things to understand:</p>
<h2 id="fun-is-an-inside-job."><strong>1. Fun is an inside
job.</strong></h2>
<p>No-one or no-thing can <em>make</em> you happy. External sources of
happiness, whether it’s a new toy, a new relationship or a new career or
project is temporary.</p>
<p>If you’re chasing happiness on the <em>outside</em>, it’s time to
change direction and go inward. Because happiness is an <em>inside</em>
job.</p>
<h2 id="emotions-are-messengers-of-your-soul.">2. Emotions are
messengers of your soul.</h2>
<p>It’s your inner GPS constantly guiding you to happiness. Learn to
understand the meaning of your emotions and find a way to meet your
needs.</p>
<p>Emotions are meant to change and the sooner you listen to the message
it has for you, the sooner the nagging will stop. Don’t ignore it, try
and understand the meaning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Loneliness</em></strong> is a need to open yourself up
and <em>connect</em>. A desire to be vulnerable and share the hidden
parts of yourself. It’s not the same as being alone. It’s neither about
sharing space and time with someone or something. It’s not being
surrounded with people.</p>
<p>It’s trying to ask you to be present with <em>yourself</em>. The more
you try to push away or ignore the loneliness, the louder it will scream
for attention. The longer and more thoughtful you sit with the
loneliness, feeling it intensely, the sooner it will fade. Loneliness is
trying to tell you to spend more time with <em>you</em>, less time with
other people and things. It’s asking you to feel what’s <em>inside</em>
— the good <em>and</em> the bad.</p>
<p><strong><em>Boredom</em></strong>, on the other hand, is an
indication that it’s time to move on. It’s time to change. It’s time to
commit. You can’t be bored when you are fully engaged (or committed) in
something.</p>
<p>When you learn or experience something new it’s exciting — the
opposite of bored. It gets boring when you’ve mastered the skill or if
it’s not relevant to you (anymore).</p>
<p><strong><em>Anger</em></strong>, which often pops up as
<strong><em>Boredom</em></strong>’s companion, is trying to push you
forward. To get you to take action. To get you moving. Even if it means
burning bridges or creating disharmony temporarily. Change can only
happen by disrupting the old patterns and creating new ones. It requires
temporary chaos and discomfort.</p>
<h2
id="fun-is-a-feeling.-and-a-feeling-is-as-a-result-of-your-thoughts.">3.
Fun is a feeling. And a feeling is as a result of your thoughts.</h2>
<p>When you think a thought that is in alignment with your true self,
you feel good. When you think a thought that is not true, it feels bad.
No exception. It’s really that simple.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Go ahead. Try it yourself. Think a positive thought
about yourself that you know is true. Repeat it a few times. How do you
feel? Now think a negative thought about yourself and repeat it. Can you
feel the downward spiral?</p>
<p>The thought is always first and the thought always creates the
feeling. The catch is that the majority of your thoughts are
subconscious - hidden beyond the surface of your conscious awareness.
What you don’t know, you don’t know. That’s where your emotions become
valuable allies.</p>
<p>The good news is that no-one - but you - can control your thoughts.
Practice thoughts that bring you joy and happiness and feel the
results.</p>
<p>So. Enough said. Let’s get practical. What can you do
<strong><em>now</em></strong> to make your day more fun?</p>
<h1 id="a-theory-of-fun">A theory of fun</h1>
<p>In my post titled <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/top-10-ingredients-of-fun-b9b14b82f1d6">Top
10 Ingredients of Fun</a> I discuss what makes something fun, after
critically analyzing <strong><em>Fun</em></strong> from different angles
and in different contexts. When you understand what makes something fun,
it’s just a matter of applying it in your life. To get you started, here
are 10 things I do to make my day more fun:</p>
<h2 id="move-more.">1. Move more.</h2>
<p>Leave your car at home and put on some comfy shoes. Walk to work if
it’s possible, or at least go for a walk during lunch time. If possible,
walk somewhere in nature or where there’s no cars.</p>
<p>Too lazy? Too cold? Too windy? Too busy? Use the Pomodoro technique
and after 20 minutes get up and walk around a bit. Each time boredom
sets in, get moving. But….</p>
<h2 id="surprise-surprise">2. Surprise, Surprise!</h2>
<p>Moving can also get boring. The key is to include something random in
your walk to make it fun.</p>
<p>Explore. Take a different route. Walk different times, distances,
directions. Curiously looking for something new that you’ve never seen
before.</p>
<p>The concept of random inputs however is not just restricted to
movement. It can be applied to anything to make it more fun. When you’re
Googling for information, try the <em>I’m feeling lucky</em> option.
Join a group or discussion that you’ve never joined before. Throw dice
to decide on priorities. Change your schedule by swapping around your
routine meetings or days. Make your weekend Friday and Saturday rather
then Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<h2 id="connect-socially.">3. Connect socially.</h2>
<p>Each day, dedicate a few minutes to really connect with people around
you. For me, I always stop at the same coffee vendor on my walk to the
office and spend a few seconds or minutes just chatting with a familiar,
friendly face.</p>
<p>I make time to be interrupted when I’m working to engage in
conversation. Mostly with familiar faces. Sometimes with strangers.</p>
<p>If all else fails, phone a friend. Or email them.</p>
<h2 id="stop.-breathe.">4. Stop. Breathe.</h2>
<p>How you connect is less important than the time you take to do it.
Sit down and grab a coffee. Be present. Stop.</p>
<p>Stop doing what you are doing. Stop thinking about work. Press the
reset button in your mind, take a few deep breaths, get up and move and
start again.</p>
<h2 id="introduce-a-physical-to-do-board.">5. Introduce a physical to-do
board.</h2>
<p>Virtual is great. You can access anything anywhere, any time. But
it’s not much fun.</p>
<p>It’s fun to see results. It’s fun to get feedback. It’s fun to feel
progress. It’s fun to touch something tangible.</p>
<p>Spend a few minutes each morning creating a physical to-do list,
making sure the tasks are small enough and realistic enough that you are
able to check-off at least some each day. Each time you finish
something, tick it off the to-do list and celebrate by rewarding
yourself with a movement break or a coffee or stretching your arms in
victory pose for a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="become-curious.">6. Become curious.</h2>
<p>Be curious about everything. Ask more questions. Why is this boring?
How can you make your day more interesting? How does that work? Who is
that person?</p>
<p>Even if you’ve done something for 50 years, there’s <em>always</em>
something new to learn about it. Re-think what you thought you knew. Get
curious about things you think is obvious. Wonder what will happen
when….</p>
<h2 id="present-meaningful-choices.">7. Present meaningful choices.</h2>
<p>Whether you’re working on a single project or with one customer, it’s
always possible to introduce options. Which part of the project would
you like to work on? Where would you like to work? Will you meet your
customer in the morning or in the afternoon?</p>
<p>Present meaningful choices. It will make you feel in control and that
feels good. Look for options and each time you start a new task,
consciously choose between two alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="practice-kaizen.">8. Practice Kaizen.</h2>
<p>It’s fun to get better. Pick the area in your daily life that is most
boring or most annoying and spend 15 minutes seeing how you can do it
differently. How can you do it easier. How can you do it better?</p>
<p>Take performance measures before (for example if it takes too long
processing your emails each morning). Spend a few minutes brainstorming
some ideas. Implement. Measure to see the improvement. Repeat.</p>
<h2 id="learn-something-new.">9. Learn something new.</h2>
<p>Insight is happiness. Learning something new guarantees a sense of
achievement, provided it’s not too difficult. Enroll in a course to
learn a new skill, preferably something that doesn’t have anything to do
with your day-job.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-fun-list.">10. Have a fun list.</h2>
<p>Spend time figuring out what you enjoy doing and write it on a list.
Each person has fun in different ways and even though the underlying
mechanics are the same, there are an unlimited number of possible things
that you can do to have fun.</p>
<p>Having a reference list of things you enjoy doing is a helpful
resource when you get stuck. Next time when you’re bored, simply pull
out the list and pick (randomly) one or more items on the list to
include in your day.</p>
<p>So there. Ten things you can do to make your day less boring. Still
bored? Sit with the feeling and figure out what it needs.</p>

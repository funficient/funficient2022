    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="an-unconventional-look-at-human-to-human-marketing-online">An
unconventional look at human-to-human marketing online</h2>
<p>Technology makes the world a smaller place. Unlike ever before in the
history of humanity, it brings equality to the world. Anyone, regardless
of age, color, race, background or geographic location can start a
digital business.</p>
<p>However, a lot of marketers look at technology as the solution to
making it big, rather than a <em>tool</em> to help you do your work
better. Everyone jumps onto the SEO and Facebook ad bandwagons hoping to
stand out, just to be surprised that it doesn’t work for them.</p>
<p>The reason, however, why it doesn’t work for you is not because the
technology doesn’t work, but more about <em>how</em> you use the
technology, and <em>when</em> you use it.</p>
<p>Technology can only do so much and no-one wants to do business with a
robot. Not for long in any case. Human marketing is marketing mimicking
human interactions, using technology to make it easier, faster, more
accessible. Not using technology to do the things you’re not good at
yet.</p>
<p>When you use a tool with the purpose of trying to do something you’re
bad with, chances are that you will just do bad things faster and to
more people at a time. The best tool in the world is still exactly that.
A tool. Just like the best knife in the world doesn’t make you a good
sushi shef, so too using the best social media tools out there is not
going to make you successful.</p>
<p>In my search for the best tools to help market myself, here are the
most valuable tools I’ve found:</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-notes">1. Thank you notes</h2>
<p>Told you my list is unconventional. By far the most useful tool I’ve
ever found to help my business grow is a simple thank you. Either as a
handwritten note, a response to a comment left on your blog, or a thank
you for retweeting or following. <em>It’s all about connection.</em>
Seeing in order to be seen as Seth Godin says it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thank you” is like magic. If meant authentically, it entices people
to do even more for you. Because everyone wants some recognition. Not
just you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gratitude is the single biggest tool to become a magnet for growth.
What you focus on, grows, and the more you notice the things going right
in your business and the people who support you, the more people will
want to support you.</p>
<h2 id="give-before-you-want-to-receive">2. Give before you want to
receive</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing. Everyone wants to be successful. Everyone wants
their business to stand out. Everyone wants to sell their products. Why
would someone choose you over the millions of choices out there?</p>
<p>Amanda Bond from <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/theadstrategist/">TheAdStrategist</a>
advises a 3 step-process for a successful ad strategy. The first step is
to <strong>connect</strong>, followed by <strong>commit</strong> and
finally <strong>close</strong>. Most people jump straight into asking a
customer to commit, without first spending time connecting though.
That’s like asking someone to marry you before you’ve even went on a
date. It’s possible that it will have a happy ending, but more likely
than not, it’s not the person you’re looking for.</p>
<p>When you build relationships from scratch in the real world, it
usually goes something like this. You go to a new place with a lot of
new faces. Let’s say it’s a coffee shop on your way to work.</p>
<p>The first few days or weeks you stick to the friendly but basic good
mornings and good byes, quietly observing to see whether you might have
a connection point with the barista or another regular. As you become
more familiar with each other, the conversations organically grow into
sharing more personal stories about yourselves, still in the safe space
of your mutual meetup place. Often, only after months or even years, do
you decide to take that next step and propose to meet in a different
place with the intention of becoming a friend or a partner.</p>
<p>Social media is no different. You don’t jump in and start asking
people to buy your products or services. You first need to give. You
first need to prove that you’re trustworthy, that you’re competent, that
you give a damn about something other than just making as much money as
possible at any cost.</p>
<p>Share your ideas. Share your stories. Share your knowledge. Comment.
Build the relationships <em>before</em> you ask for something in return.
Be generous with your giving and people will be generous to you in
return.</p>
<h2 id="have-an-opinion.-and-a-personality.">3. Have an opinion. And a
personality.</h2>
<p>Copying someone you admire is a good start, but it’s not enough to
make you stand out in the digital world. Dig a little deeper. What makes
you unique? What do you do differently than the rest? What makes you
<em>human</em>?</p>
<p>My favorite example is Marie Forleo with her fun and quirky weekly <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marieforleo">Marie TV YouTube
channel</a>. I love it because she doesn’t follow the status quo. She
does it <em>her</em> way. She makes jokes and do funny stuff with swag.
She doesn’t give advise based on what the rule book says, but what
<em>she</em> says. In <em>her</em> voice. She has an opinion and she has
a personality. <em>That’s</em> being human!</p>
<p>Her newer work is more professional with a slightly different feel,
but here’s an example of why I fell in love with her years ago in one of
her typical weekly Q&amp;A video’s for marketers.</p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FvCTPonTQOGA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvCTPonTQOGA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FvCTPonTQOGA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube">How
to Tell If Your Marketing Strategy Is Worth the Effort</a></p>
<p>Another favorite of mine is <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene">Yoga with
Adrienne</a>, another YouTube channel offering weekly yoga classes with
a whole lot of personality. Actor trained yogi, <em>I love Adrienne
because every week’s lesson is something different and fun. It’s yoga
for real people living in the real world. One of the best examples of
why I feel in love with her is in this video for Yoga when you’re angry.
Because yogi’s get angry too.</em></p>
<p><a
href="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fie5yjNGLxfQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Die5yjNGLxfQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fie5yjNGLxfQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube">Yoga
For When You’re Angry</a></p>
<p>I love how she always brings some personality to each video.
Sometimes her dog joins in the session. Sometimes she dresses up
according to the theme. Sometimes she makes jokes or start singing at
inappropriate times (according to convention that is, not an Adrienne
fan). She does and say things she would do when she’s relaxed in front
of friends. <em>Human</em> things. Not politically correct and scripted
things only.</p>
<p>If you can’t relax and be yourself in front of your audience, how do
you expect them to be comfortable to continue a conversation with you?
Just as in real life, you connect better with people when they’re
relaxed and authentic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authenticity is magnetic. People see it (or rather feel it) a mile
away.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beat-your-drum-to-the-rhythm-of-your-heart">4. Beat your drum to
the rhythm of your heart</h2>
<p>In music, there’s a rhythm and a balance with the chorus repeated
from time to time. Not all the time (that is called spam), just from
time to time. It’s the perfect balance between creating familiarity and
introducing something new in each verse.</p>
<p>In real life, when you repeat the same story over and over and over
again, you’re boring. Or irritating. The same applies to social media.
Don’t just sell your products or just advertise, share some insights,
have group discussions, tell us how it’s made, what’s happening behind
the scenes.</p>
<p>Find your rhythm. And be consistent. Don’t share everything. Be
discerning. But also don’t be a robot predictably sharing every hour.
The ocean ebs and flows. The seasons change from summer to winter.
Sometimes post more, other times less. Use scheduling tools like <a
href="https://buffer.com">Buffer</a> with the purpose of reaching people
in different timezones, not to become a robot.</p>
<p>It’s about continuing the conversation. Keeping the connection
going.</p>
<h2 id="persevere">5. Persevere</h2>
<p>Digital marketing is different from face-to-face marketing in that
often you don’t get any feedback at all. You don’t know why people
aren’t clicking or buying. You don’t know why they liked a post if they
do. It’s mostly a guessing game (even with analytics) as most people
refrain from giving honest feedback digitally in the fear of being
labeled or attacked by an internet troll or risk sounding stupid. Or
maybe it’s just that they haven’t thought about it yet and have no
opinion right now.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for not responding, just know that when you
embark on any digital form of commerce or relationship building that
it’s a long and lonely journey for a long time before you start getting
responses.</p>
<p>Don’t give up too soon. Just keep going. Eventually, someone
somewhere out there will see you and press that Contact Us button.</p>
<h1 id="close-with-a-call-to-action">Close with a Call to Action</h1>
<p>In real life, a conversation with a friend usually ends with some
form of next step. If you meet someone you really like and he asks for
your number, you give it to him. If he doesn’t ask, conversation ends.
If you don’t give it, conversation ends.</p>
<p>Do you want people to like or share your post? Do you want people to
hire you? Do you want people to follow you and build a more long term
relationship?</p>
<p>It takes being explicit about what you want and not being afraid to
say it. Don’t leave people hanging and don’t be obnoxious.</p>

<h2 id="book-review">Book review</h2>
<p><em>A critical analysis of organizational development and a book on
what the next paradigm of leadership within an organizational context
might look like. The book draws on developmental psychology as framework
to explain the development of organizations. It is an inspiring read
painting a hopeful future for organizations focused on wholeness and
self-managing teams.</em></p>
<h1 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h1>
<p>The book is a resource to help forward thinking leaders and CEO’s,
team coaches, Human Resources and everyone interested in developing more
self-managed organizations with less bureaucracy.</p>
<p>It’s an objective analysis written in an academic, yet conversational
style. It analytically and objectively evaluates the structure and
elements of organizations, yet touches on holistic concepts and
spiritual practice. It’s for the more open-minded reader looking at the
next phase of organizational development.</p>
<h1 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h1>
<p>The book consists of three parts, the first focused on drawing a
<strong><em>comparison</em></strong> between <strong><em>organizational
development</em></strong> throughout history and developmental
psychology. The second part fleshes out what a Teal Organization looks
like based on <strong><em>case studies from different
organizations</em></strong>, and the final part looks at what
<strong><em>conditions are needed for such an environment</em></strong>
to exist and thrive.</p>
<p><img

<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s a practical handbook and analysis of how “developed”
organizations looks like and how it is run.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book starts with a history of organizational development,
comparing each major shift in organizational development to a specific
color, starting with red, moving on to amber, then orange, green and
finally teal as briefly described below.</p>
<p>Red organizations are described as impulsive and mostly driven by
fear, taking what is wanted as the impulse arises with not much thought
as to the impact on others inside or outside the area of influence.</p>
<p>Amber organizations brought structure and thus repeatability to an
organization, introducing roles for the first time in the history of
organizations. This meant that an organization can continue operating
without being dependent on a specific person or leader.</p>
<p>Orange, the dominant structure of organizations today, are compared
to a machine, focused wholly on profits and results, viewing people as
cogs in a wheel that need to be told when to do what. Even the name
human resources are indicative of this perspective, viewing people as a
replaceable resource to be managed. This paradigm brought accountability
and the concept of meritocracy to organizations, allowing each person,
regardless of their caste or background, to rise to the top of an
organization.</p>
<p>Green organizations are typically identified in the non-profit
sector, focused on values based leadership and consent by everyone in
the team. They brought the concept of empowerment and diverse
stakeholders rather than shareholders as the only important investor in
an organization. It lifted up the importance of the workers and broke
down the top-down hierarchy of the typical orange bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Teal organizations add an element of wholeness to
organizations, balancing the orange vertical structure and green
horizontal structure into a well-balanced self-managed structure where
focus shifts from profit to purpose.</em></p>
<p>The book goes into extensive detail as to
<strong><em>what</em></strong> the such organizations look like. It is
filled with real life interviews with successful self-managing
organizations of more than 100 employees and operating more than 5
years. Most of these organizations, even though their focus is on an
evolutionary purpose, seems to be more profitable than the
profit-focused orange industries. Case study after case study points to
how accidentally the growth and profit seem to be when the focus is on
something bigger than making money.</p>
<p>The focus of the book is <strong><em>comparing the structures and
practices</em></strong> of orange organizations, our current dominant
bureaucratic operating mode for managing organizations, and teal
organizations, which bring an element of wholeness and
self-actualization — the highest level in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
model — to organizations, reducing the layers of hierarchy towards
self-managing teams with no, or at least very little, centralized
support functions. <em>Throughout the book comparisons are drawn between
scientific studies and academic works, making it a believable read
rather than a far-fetched ideology.</em></p>
<p>It also touches on what is needed for a transition and includes some
failed transitions explaining the reason for the failure, mostly always
directly related to the leadership team.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="the-writing-style">The writing style</h2>
<p>The book is an easy and interesting read, written mostly in a
conversational style, explaining concepts well and from many different
angles.</p>
<p>Each analysis is summarized into tables, making comparisons between
the different paradigms easy to comprehend and compare.</p>
<p>It is easy to point out what makes Teal organizations different to
Orange organizations, clearly showing the additions and differences
between the two and what Teal organizations add to the already
successful age of Orange companies.</p>
<h1 id="i-like-i-wish-i-wonder">I like, I wish, I wonder…</h1>
<p>The content is <strong><em>original</em></strong>,
<strong><em>fresh</em></strong> and
<strong><em>interesting</em></strong>. As an avid reader, it is not
often that I stumble upon a book with entirely new ideas. This
definitely feels “new” and unique with only a handful of organizations
currently considered Teal.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>case studies</em></strong> and detailed recollections
of the interviews with the different organizations are extremely
helpful. Each section takes into account at least two or three different
organizations to explain how they operate.</p>
<p>Similarities are drawn between different types of organizations,
making the book accessible to everyone, not limiting the implementation
to only a specific industry or demographic group.</p>
<p>The list of <strong><em>interview questions</em></strong> right at
the end is an extremely useful resource, allowing anyone to evaluate and
analyze the operating mode for their organization and might even be
turned into a checklist.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>structure</em></strong> of the book is both an
<strong><em>aid to reading and an impediment</em></strong>. The
different functions are well-defined and broken down into different
sections that are easy to find for the busy reader or someone looking
for specific contents without having to re-read the entire book, yet,
this also means that there are a lot of points that are repeated, making
the last section of the book less interesting.</p>
<p>What’s <strong><em>missing</em></strong> for a more complete resource
is more details on <strong><em>how</em></strong> to transition towards
such an organization to enable more organizations to reach this state in
the evolution of organizations. The majority of the book focuses on
looking at experiences of existing Teal Organizations and although it
does touch on the transitions, it is not in enough detail for
organizations to action. A lot of the guidance provided is from the
perspective of a leader who is already in this evolved state of
leadership, making it inaccessible to a leader on a lower evolutionary
state to understand what they can do differently to change.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>characteristics</em></strong> of a Teal leader is not
explained or discussed and there are only end-states described, not a
<strong><em>strategy</em></strong> for a successful transition.</p>
<p>Finally, I love the <strong><em>pay-what-feels-right model of
pricing</em></strong>, as not only does it make the book more accessible
to people who can’t afford expensive books, but more importantly,
provides direct feedback to the author with regards to the perceived
value of the contents. The more people are willing to pay, the more
useful they find the contents.</p>

<h1 id="about-the-author">About the author</h1>
<p><strong><em>Frederic Laloux</em></strong> has an educational
background in coaching and an MBA from INSEAD. He advises companies on
how to run organizations in new ways, as explained in the book.</p>
<p>He is deeply fascinated with human development and it is the marriage
of this fascination and his deep understanding of the inner workings of
organizations as a result of years working as a consultant, that created
this new paradigm in leading organizations.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Reinventing Organizations is an insightful, fresh read re-evaluating
how organizations are structured and run. It introduces a more “whole”
type of organization where there is an integration of soul and role,
rather than a separation as is often the case in Orange
organizations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A must read for anyone that feels agile has reached it’s limits and
looking for what is next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only software development company included in the case studies
are Halocracy, with the difference between any agile book and this that
the focus is on the organizational structure, not the method of
operation.</p>

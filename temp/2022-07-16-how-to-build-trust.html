    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h2 id="psychologial-safety-from-the-ground-up">Psychologial Safety from
the ground up</h2>
<p>I’m not a mother, and I don’t understand the built-in drive to
protect a child the same way a mother does. I don’t understand the labor
pains of birthing a child into the world.</p>
<p>I have, however, birthed an idea that I’m nurturing into a startup.
It’s my baby. Something very precious to me. I don’t know if it’s any
good, but I do know it’s mine and I care about it as a mother cares for
her child.</p>
<p>Birthing ideas are not very different to birthing babies after all.
They start off as just a fun idea, then grow inside your mind where
no-one can see it until it becomes too big and uncomfortable to hold in.
Finally, it is birthed through a lot of emotional pain. If, after all,
it was easy to birth good ideas, everyone would do it.</p>
<p>When a new startup comes into the world as a small little seed, it is
vulnerable and in need of protection and nurturing just like a newborn
baby. <a
href="https://medium.com/teal-times/unpacking-psychological-safety-9f157ef3c8ca">Safety</a>
is a prerequisite for its survival. When safety is compromised in any
way, trust is broken. With no trust, there can be no meaningful
relationship to nurture this seed and it will never grow into a
tree.</p>
<h1 id="a-tale-of-broken-trust">A tale of broken trust</h1>
<p>I recently reached out to someone to help me build my startup. What I
needed was something he had — a relationship with the key stakeholder I
plan to approach as my first, and most important, customer. I didn’t
want anything else, just an introduction.</p>
<p>I reached out to him with my request and he agreed with one condition
— that he wants to know more about the idea before he connects me with
his network.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>I agreed, trusting he will keep my newly baby safe. After all, a few
weeks earlier when the yet unfinished idea was first birthed he
explicitly said he will follow my lead on this and asked me what I
needed. No reason not to trust him.</p>
<p>So our relationship started off with 100% trust in my barometer, even
though he was a near stranger. Each time we interacted with each other,
the trust was either maintained or compromised. At first, trust was kept
high on both ends. Our communication was great, we both kept out
promises and it felt as if we were on the same page. I was enthusiastic
that my idea might become something real!</p>
<p>Slowly but surely though, he started slacking, as if he didn’t need
to maintain the trust after the initial interactions built enough trust.
He started living in his head, not sharing his expectations or thoughts
with me. I asked questions but got no response. It felt as if he started
taking over the idea, making it into something much bigger and different
than what it is intended to be at this early stage. He started moving it
into a different direction than what I wanted it to go and I started
feeling more and more misunderstood.</p>
<p>As I became aware of the growing gap in expectations, I immediately
tried to remedy it with more explicit questions, outlining my
expectations and inviting him to outline his. I received silence in
return. His focus was on the future version of the startup and very far
away from the current reality and the immediate next step to take it to
fruition.</p>
<p>Each time I shared and didn’t receive an answer to my question, the
barometer of trust cooled down just a bit. Each time I sensed the
expectation gap widening between us, the temperature in the barometer
slided downward.</p>
<p>Then, finally we sat down and I presented all the things he asked for
as per our agreement. I again asked what he wanted, and eventually got a
vague response. The answer had commitment, but lacked the substance I
put on the table. It felt as if I gave everything and he gave 10%. Trust
minus one again.</p>
<p>On the follow-up, which marked the end of the first milestone we set,
trust was finally broken completely. His previous eagerness has cooled
down to a “I’ll get to it when I have time”. My urgency grew as his
aloofness grew. Finally, he responded by saying he needs to protect his
network and is not willing to share the contact with me. Trust on zero,
but with a possibility to be redeemed.</p>
<p>I asked him what changed in our agreement?</p>
<p>He didn’t really have a valid reason. It felt as if he was just
buying more time to allow him to point out something crucially missing
in the information I provided. What he said now and what he said earlier
started to contradict each other.</p>
<p>But then he did the unforgivable. He shared the idea with a third
party whom I don’t know and whom he never introduced to me or explained
how this person fits into the picture, all without my consent or input.
His choice of words also indicated that he has now taken ownership of my
baby and that I was merely an instrument to help him reach his goals. It
felt as if there were no “we” left. Only a him. My needs forgotten.</p>
<p>This terribly-gone-wrong interaction made me spend a lot of time
self-reflecting. What could I have done differently? Where did it go
wrong? After all, it started off so good. And most of all, how do you
build a nurturing, safe environment from the ground up?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Safety is formed when you build more trust than what you
break.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="learning-from-failure"><strong>Learning from
failure</strong></h1>
<p>No-one is superman. Even the best of the best have their flaws. <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/03/11/how-to-become-the-perfect-leader/">Perfection</a>
is something that makes you unapproachable and inhumane, someone who
no-one can relate to, even though they might look up to that person.
It’s those flaws and those mistakes that make you more admirable, more
human, more approachable.</p>
<p>The key to building safety is not to try to be perfect and never make
a mistake, but balancing and correcting when you do, to always keep the
barometer above freezing point.</p>
<p>Here are the lesson I learned from our interaction — both the good
and the bad.</p>
<h1 id="building-trust"><strong>Building trust</strong></h1>
<h2 id="communicate-often">1. Communicate often</h2>
<p><a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/02/08/how-feedback-makes-you-more-productive/">Feedback</a>
is the most crucial aspect of a trust-based relationship. Regularly
catch-up, especially in the early stages of the relationship. Rather
over-communicate than under-communicate in the initial phases.</p>
<p>Don’t assume anything.</p>
<h2 id="communicate-in-person">2. Communicate in person</h2>
<p>Face-to-face <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2016/12/22/answer-life-universe-everything/">communication</a>
is by far the most effective form of communication. It’s, however, not
realistic or possible for two busy people in different locations to meet
in person daily.</p>
<p>When, however, there is the slightest risk of trust being
compromised, get together in person and talk about it.</p>
<h2 id="practice-good-listening">3. Practice good listening</h2>
<p>When you’re busy thinking about a response or how you would do it,
you’re not listening to the other person. Good listening requires you to
clear your mind and focus your attention outward onto the other person
speaking.</p>
<p>Good listening boils down to searching for what the other person
needs from you. What does he need to hear? What does he need to feel
safe? What does he need to move forward?</p>
<h2 id="actions-speak-louder-than-words">4. Actions speak louder than
words</h2>
<p>Being a good listening doesn’t merely mean you <em>hear</em> the
words spoken. It requires you to react and respond to it. Actions speak
<em>much</em> louder than words.</p>
<p>Talk is cheap. Rather, put your money where your mouth is and do
something to prove you have heard and understood what the other person
needs.</p>
<h2 id="be-honest">5. Be honest</h2>
<p>One of the hardest things for the human race is to be honest about
their needs, their wants and mostly, their emotions. Understandably.
No-one would willingly hurt another when they realize that by hurting
that person you are only hurting yourself.</p>
<p>However, shying away from having difficult conversations hurts much
more than the hurt of the truth. When you are honest about both the good
and the bad you experience, you allow the other person to give you more
of the good and an opportunity to change the bad.</p>
<p>When you only want to be the good guy, you deny the other person an
opportunity to improve and strengthen a relationship. You also deny
yourself from meeting your own needs above someone else’s needs.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-an-agreement-on-expectations">6. Start with an
agreement on expectations</h2>
<p>In a budding new relationship, whether one-on-one or in a team
setting, one of the most important things to do is to explicitly clarify
and agree on expectations. It doesn’t have to be a formal sit-down, but
it needs to be explicit enough for both parties to think about and agree
on expectations.</p>
<p>The bigger the expectation gap gets, the harder it gets to close. By
starting with agreeing on expectations, even though it might be vague
and bound to change, you are starting with a strong foundation and a 0
deficit on the trust barometer.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-promises">7. Keep your promises</h2>
<p>When you make an appointment for 2pm, be there at <em>2pm</em>. Or
earlier. When you said you will introduce me to your network when I meet
your expectations, do it.</p>
<p><a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2017/11/24/living-integrity/">Integrity</a>
is probably the biggest indicator of both respect and trust. Say what
you do and do what you say. Always. No exception.</p>
<h2 id="set-small-goals">8. Set small goals</h2>
<p>Dream big. Start small.</p>
<p>Start with a small goal and meet that before moving onto the next,
bigger goal. Having too big a goal too early in the process is like
asking someone to marry them on a first date. It’s probably not very
realistic.</p>
<p>A startup first, above everything else, needs to gain traction. The
business world can learn a lot from this. Once there is enough traction,
growth is much easier, but those initial steps are the crucial ones that
differentiate success from failure. Making that initial step too big is
setting yourself up for failure.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-trust"><strong>Breaking trust</strong></h2>
<p>On the other side of the coin, here are some things that break
trust.</p>
<h2 id="not-responding">1. Not responding</h2>
<p>Not responding is a a deal breaker. When you don’t respond it
indicates that you don’t value the other person.</p>
<p>It is better to respond with a one-liner setting a clear expectation
with when you will be able to respond more fully than not responding
with the intent of responding more comprehensively.</p>
<p>Say <em>“I got your mail, I will only be able to respond by Monday.
Is that ok?”</em> or something similar that acknowledge the interaction.
Without responding communication is a one-way street and that is not
communication.</p>
<h2 id="being-late-and-managing-time">2. Being late and managing
time</h2>
<p>Your time is not more valuable than mine, even though you might
believe it is. Being late is an indication of the level of respect you
have for the other person.</p>
<p>Being late should be an exception, rather than the rule. It should be
used in <em>necessary</em> situations, not out of habit. When you are
late for a first meeting, it immediately sets an expectation that it is
acceptable to be late.</p>
<p>When you’re not able to manage your own time, how are you to be
trusted in managing something like a business?</p>
<h2 id="telling-rather-than-asking">3. Telling rather than asking</h2>
<p>Our world’s biggest disease today is their inability to ask. Ask for
help, ask for clarity, ask for input, ask for forgiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without a question, there is no conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you want someone to come to an event, <em>ask</em> them
politely. Sending a message saying <em>“There is an event that I’m
hosting, hope you can make it.”</em> is not a question. It is a
statement that communicates that it’s all about you and that whether the
recipient comes or not is really not important. It is merely a bulletin
to inform you. Asking <em>“There is an event that I’m hosting. I would
love for you to attend. Would you like to join?”</em> sounds inviting,
inclusive, as if the other person matters.</p>
<p>Which feels better?</p>
<h2 id="being-too-busy">4. Being too busy</h2>
<p>Being busy I have found is 80% of the time not productive. When I
hear that you are too busy for me, I hear that I am not important and
that my input in the matter is not needed. In other words, I am
insignificant compared to other things on your to-do list.</p>
<p>If you want to build trust, make time to respond. Make time to
listen. Make time to build the relationship.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean being a brat or selfish. It means respect the other
person’s expectations.</p>
<h2 id="using-i-rather-than-we">5. Using “I” rather than “we”</h2>
<p>Culture is formed around conversations. The importance of vocabulary
is extremely under-rated. Changing a single word in a sentence has the
potential to make a much bigger change in perception than a lot of
actions.</p>
<p>When you say <em>“I”</em> when you talk about the product it
indicates you own it. If you want shared ownership, make sure that you
use <em>“we”</em>.</p>
<p>When you say <em>“I”</em> when expressing a need, however, it
indicates responsibility. Using <em>“we”</em> or <em>“you”</em>
indicates that you’re not willing to own your own needs or emotions. It
assumes that you know best for the other person, without asking their
perspective first.</p>
<h2 id="shifting-the-goalposts">6. Shifting the goalposts</h2>
<p>When you say the milestone that marks when you will be ready to share
your contacts with me is once you have enough information on the
product, moving it breaks trust.</p>
<p>Keep to the initial agreement, or agree to shift it
<em>collaboratively</em>. Never without consulting the other party.</p>
<h2 id="talking-rather-than-doing">7. Talking rather than doing</h2>
<p>Talk is cheap. In the startup world, early feedback and failing fast
are the crucial first steps towards success. The more you talk about a
solution and how to get it perfect, the less time you spend doing
something about it, the longer it takes to get feedback, the more likely
you are to fail or get it wrong.</p>
<p><em>Timing is everything.</em></p>
<h2 id="not-asking-permission">8. Not asking permission</h2>
<p>When you share trade secrets with a third party without consent, it
is like having an affair. You are breaking trust.</p>
<p>Only ever disclose secrets entrusted to you with the permission of
the person who shared it with you.</p>
<h1 id="trust-is-earned">Trust is earned</h1>
<p>Trust is a barometer than needs constant attention to keep its
warmth. It’s not a milestone that you can reach and keep forever, just
like an oven’s thermostat constantly clicks on and off to maintain its
heat.</p>
<p>You need to <em>actively</em> work at maintaining trust, adding more
trust-worthy actions than compromising trust.</p>
<p>Whether you are a leader or a father or a friend, your primary focus
should be on <a

safety</a>. Only when the other person feels safe is it possible to
build something together.</p>

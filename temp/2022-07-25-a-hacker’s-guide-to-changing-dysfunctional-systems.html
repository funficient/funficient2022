    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

Systems</h1>

<h2 id="hacking-for-organizational-growth">Hacking for organizational
growth</h2>
<p>There is a difference between dysfunctional and broken.</p>
<p>Broken means something doesn’t work at all. Dysfunctional means it
works, but not for the good of all the parties involved and definitely
not in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>In dysfunctional systems a pyramid typically forms until the base
gets too weak to support the top and the entire pyramid collapses. The
majority of the organizations in existence today falls into this
category, where the focus is on maximizing profit for a handful while
the majority of the workforce is being disadvantaged and even exploited
to such a degree that they burn-out or walk away.</p>
<p>Some call this capitalism.</p>
<h2 id="capitalism-or-captivity">Capitalism or Captivity?</h2>
<p><strong>Capitalism</strong>, or rather true capitalism, however,
cannot exist for long in such a dysfunctional system just as a farmer
can not sustainably keep harvesting without also investing in the
quality of the soil and keeping some of the best seeds for the next
season. When all the seeds are sold, it’s like slaughtering the goose
that lays the golden eggs. In the business world, the people is your
golden goose.</p>
<p>If you’re a business owner and capitalist, it is thus in your best
interest to ensure that the system that runs your business remains
functional and in harmony with the environment.</p>
<h2 id="baby-boomers-vs-millennials">Baby Boomers vs Millennials</h2>
<p>The Baby Boomers enjoyed being managed. Being managed meant quality.
Quality meant profit. Profit meant security.</p>
<p>Millennials, on the other hand, dislike being managed. Being managed
means being controlled. Being controlled means unable to have fun and be
creative and a quality of life. Being unable to innovate and enjoy what
you do means losses and failure. It means financial losses for the
company and losing yourself as a human being, trying to be what those
before you were.</p>
<p><em>The currency for success in the age of the Millennial is employee
happiness and innovation. The business systems focused on management and
control therefore does more harm than good for both the business owner
as well as the employee.</em> Business systems who are able to let go of
control a little, have a lot to gain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s time for change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not because the systems are bad or wrong. Just because. Well. They
don’t fit anymore. Just like a 5 year old needs a new, bigger outfit
each year. One that fits.</p>
<h1 id="hacking-for-growth">Hacking for Growth</h1>
<p>My road crossed a few criminals and hackers and I noticed how
effortlessly they seem to get what they want breaking the rules while
here I was being punished for being a good citizen.</p>
<p>Curiously, I started exploring what goes on in the mind of a hacker
and how it can be used for the good. This is what I’ve learned:</p>
<h2 id="rule-1.-start-with-the-end-in-mind">Rule #1. Start with the end
in mind</h2>
<p>A hacker or criminal starts with a goal in mind. They <em>know</em>
what they want. They might not know exactly what it looks like or when
it will present itself, but they know they want a fix and will do
whatever it takes to get it.</p>
<p>Whether you’re one person looking for change or an entire
organization embarking on a change initiative, the first step is
deciding where you want to go and why. What’s your end goal? What does
success look like?</p>
<p>If your answer is to make money, ask yourself what you would do with
the money. What makes you happy? How do you want to feel? What do you
want more of? What do you want less of?</p>
<p>Read more about this in my post entitled <strong><a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/why-the-goal-should-never-be-to-make-money-79a6fe9e513f">Why
The Goal Should Never Be To Make Money</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rule-2.-define-your-ransom">Rule #2. Define your ransom</h2>
<p>A criminal demands their ransom and is unwilling to yield or
negotiate. They know that yielding will show doubt and doubt shows
weakness.</p>
<p>Whenever you hit a fork in the road of organizational or personal
change, know your ransom. What are you willing to give up and what not
with your personal values being your guide. If your most important value
is trust, make sure that you make choices that will keep and build trust
within and outside of the organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be very clear on your personal values and what you are willing to
sacrifice and at what price.</p>
<p>What is your ransom?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rule-3.-be-patient">Rule #3. Be patient</h2>
<p>A hacker or criminal doesn’t simply jump in and hack a person’s
account at the first opportunity they get. They usually first spend time
searching for potential victims and try to identify behavior patterns.
Only once they have a high degree of certainty that the risk of being
caught has been minimized do they act. Sometimes it takes hours, other
times months or even years.</p>
<p>In organizational and personal change, first spend time to
objectively observe. Get to know your players. Study the history of the
company and the people. Find the patterns, the pains and the gains.
Attempt to see how it could have been beneficial in the past and how
this can be used as leverage or influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don’t fight the system, rather, find it’s vulnerability and how
to exploit it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rule-4.-make-friends">Rule #4. Make friends</h2>
<p>Criminal activity is usually an inside job (in South Africa in any
case).</p>
<p>I once lived next door to the nicest man I’ve met. He also happened
to be the head of the body corporate handling the finances for the
sectional title property I lived in and owned. He was
<strong><em>always</em></strong> friendly,
<strong><em>always</em></strong> going out of his way to help his
neighbours, never got angry. Nice. <strong><em>Too</em></strong> nice.
“Normal” people get annoyed and angry and have bad days. He didn’t seem
to have any bad days. Ever.</p>
<p>It turned out he was part of a syndicate stealing from me and my
neighbours. He did this so obviously, yet, no-one bothered to notice as
he was just too nice for anyone to question him.</p>
<p>Criminals invest a lot of time in getting you to like and trust them
enough for you to show your vulnerability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An organization or team consists first and foremost of people.
Without first investing in building strong relationships with these
people, chances are the organizational boat will be shipwrecked when the
first storm hits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spend time building relationships before you start breaking down the
building. When the going gets tough (which it’s bound to), these strong
relationships will be your lifeline.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5.-play-by-the-rules">Rule #5. Play by the rules</h2>
<p>I’ve rarely met a ‘normal’ person who knows all the laws by heart or
the banking policies and procedures of the bank they use. Usually, they
don’t even know the different fees for different transactions. They rely
on the goodness of the general population, knowing that when they are
charged for something it is correct.</p>
<p>Criminals, on the other hand, know the rules by heart. They know when
to break which laws and how to respond when they do. They study the laws
continuously, looking for the weaknesses and how to see opportunity when
it arises.</p>
<p>Even though many companies say they want change, when it happens they
don’t like it much and will punish the change-makers. If you want
organizational change, first and foremost follow the rules. To the T.
Make changes where there are no rules or the rules are weak or
confusing. While you follow the rules, no-one is able to touch you.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6.-dont-confuse-being-meek-with-being-weak">Rule #6. Don’t
confuse being meek with being weak</h2>
<p>Being weak is not the same as being meek, yet many people confuse
these. Being weak is lacking strength while being meek requires great
strength.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*91saqMWWEGUR0dAO3cCr0w.png" /></p>
<p>To change a dysfunctional system don’t attempt to swim upstream.
Allow yourself to flow downstream and protect yourself as best you can
against the bruises and bumps as you hit obstacles in the road rather
than attempting to avoid it.</p>
<p>Say yes to everything and be submissive to authorities. Sustainable
change happens inside-out, bottom-up. Remain meek, be humble and always
present yourself as the least important person in the room (which is
also a Buddhist teaching on how to achieve happiness).</p>
<p>By remaining meek, you gain the trust of authorities who will
eventually, given enough patience, hand you what you want on a golden
platter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Influence is built by trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First build trust before you start changing the system.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7.-dont-cry-wolf">Rule #7. Don’t cry wolf</h2>
<p>When you have a faulty alarm that keeps going off, a thief will
capitalize on this and use it as an opportunity to break in. Even when
the alarm does go off, chances are no-one will react as they assume it
to be yet another false alarm.</p>
<p>When you constantly complain or have an opinion about everything,
people tend to ignore you. When, however, you keep to yourself, the
times you do voice your opinion, they will respect you and hear what you
have to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Timing is everything. It’s not what you say, but when you say
it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only raise a controversial issue once you’ve built enough trust and
respect to know that people will hear you when you have something to
say. Saying the same thing prematurely will result in resistance.
Waiting for the perfect time results in change.</p>
<h2 id="rule-8.-allow-yourself-to-be-imperfect">Rule #8. Allow yourself
to be imperfect</h2>
<p>No-one likes to hear how wrong or mean or imperfect they are. From a
young age we’re taught that successful people don’t make mistakes. A
good manager is (<em>was</em>) one who knows all the answers, the one
who never makes a mistake, the one who always remains calm, even under
pressure.</p>
<p>A successful leader on the other hand is someone who is willing to
make mistakes, knowing that mistakes is a better teacher than always
being right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s better to apologize than to be right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience, apologizing after being unreasonable or wrong has
opened up more opportunities and gained me more respect than being proud
or arrogant and refusing to admit my part in a mistake.</p>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes. That’s what makes you human. It’s what you
do <em>after</em> you’ve made a mistake that is an indication of your
character and how much people will respect you.</p>
<p>For cultural change to happen, sometimes it’s necessary to model
mistakes and failures and how to deal with it rather than trying to show
them how to be perfect.</p>
<h2 id="rule-9.-never-look-back">Rule #9. Never look back</h2>
<p>The opportunity for theft presents itself unannounced to the criminal
who is always on the lookout. They seize the moment and act fast. Once
the crime was committed, they get themselves out of the way and never
look back. They know that looking back will only make them vulnerable to
being arrested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Act fast. Move fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Real-time change beats planned change initiatives by far. When an
opportunity for change presents itself to you, don’t wait. Act. Don’t
overthink it, don’t over analyze. Just do it. Without any remorse.
What’s done is done and can not be undone. Hold your head up high and
stick to your guns, however hard it might be. And refer back to rule
#8.</p>
<p>You’ll teach integrity when you do and people will follow suit and
that’s how change happens. One change-opportunity at a time.</p>
<h2 id="rule-10.-celebrate-success">Rule #10. Celebrate success</h2>
<p>In most of the organizational change programs I’ve been involved in,
the project starts off with a lot of celebration and focus and as the
project starts running, less and less focus is put. It fizzles out until
the change initiative is only a memory with people returning to their
old habits and ways of working.</p>
<p>For change to stick, it’s important to celebrate when something goes

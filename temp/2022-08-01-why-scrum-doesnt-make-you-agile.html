<h2 id="how-to-make-the-most-of-scrum-on-your-agile-journey">How to make
the most of Scrum on your agile journey</h2>
<p>Just like reading a book doesn’t guarantee you are able to use the
knowledge contained within it, so too following the rules of Scrum
doesn’t guarantee that you are able to live the <a
href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">manifesto for agile software
development</a>.</p>
<p>Scrum might indeed be the golden bullet you have been looking for,
but it’s of little use without the gun and knowing how to use the gun.
This post is intended to help you find the gun to load the golden
bullet. It contains a few reasons why Scrum is not enough to make you
agile, followed by how to get the most out of it and how to use it in
order for it to be the golden bullet you hoped it would be when you
embarked on your agile transformation.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer. This is not intended to be a criticism of Scrum (for
my opinion on why Scrum works, <a
href="https://everydayagile.com/why-scrum-works-f74638b13ea5">read
this</a>), but rather a call for people to realize that there might be
life after Scrum and to invite them to look at alternatives outside of
the Scrum framework.</em></p>
<h2 id="reason-1-its-a-static-recipe.">Reason # 1 — It’s a static
recipe.</h2>
<p>Scrum is a pre-defined process containing a set of fixed rituals and
roles that remain unchanged throughout its implementation. Inherently,
this is un-agile, with the first line of the agile manifesto being</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are uncovering better ways of developing software…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…implying that there is constant change underlying an agile
organization.</p>
<p>Agile in its essence is about cultivating a learning mindset that is
able to perceive changes in the environment that might influence the
business and adapting to these changes faster than your competitors.
<em>By sticking to Scrum as it is without adapting the process, teams,
sprints and even the rituals as the founders suggest, it is subliminally
teaching you not to find better ways to do the work. It’s teaching you
to be obedient and follow the rules and not question what authorities
think is the best for you.</em></p>
<h2 id="solution-1-keep-curious.-keep-moving.">Solution #1 —Keep
curious. Keep moving.</h2>
<p>View it for what it is — a framework — not a methodology. An empty
shell that needs to be filled in with the details by each organization
or team.</p>
<p>The Scrum rituals can be a great starting point for your agile
journey, but it is only the first step of going agile as I explained in
more detail in a <a
href="https://medium.com/@funficient/scrum-is-only-the-beginning-of-going-agile-2e984ac7f348">previous
post</a>.</p>
<p>All teams I have worked with naturally adapted their standard Scrum
board to a more Kanban like board to depict the actual workflow rather
than simply using it as a task board.</p>
<p><em>A Scrum board is an excellent starting point for an agile
transition but it will soon not be adequate to reflect the bottlenecks
stopping the team from achieving their goals and it should be
adapted.</em></p>
<p>Other than Kanban boards, there are many agile techniques out there
that is not covered in Scrum at all. XP contains a bunch of useful and
more practical techniques, including pair programming and TDD (test
driven development). Then there is a selection of ideas and methods
contained within the Lean Startup Methodology which can be applied, Lean
Manufacturing is another rich source of methods and my favorite is
gamestorming — a selection of tried and tested low-tech techniques to
improve collaboration and creativity within a group.</p>
<p>Don’t stop with Scrum. It’s just a framework. Keep looking for more
useful ways to do things and fill in the blanks. Keep reading blogs of
fellow agile enthusiasts to gain insights and ideas to take your agile
transformation to the next level.</p>
<h2
id="reason-2-it-values-following-a-plan-over-responding-to-change.">Reason
# 2 — It values following a plan over responding to change.</h2>
<p>The goal of agility is to do more with less resources, faster.
Productivity and agility goes hand in hand and the only way to achieve
this is by adapting to change in order to meet the goal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum
guide</a> suggests that the sprint, for example, is time-boxed and
should have consistent durations throughout development, valuing the
plan over responding to change.</p>
<p><em>Although the intention of this approach has merit, in real life,
shit happens.</em> Sometimes you really need just one more day.
Sometimes you finish earlier and it doesn’t make sense picking the next
story. Sometimes there’s an earthquake. Or Easter holidays. Or simply
just too many non-sprint required tasks that keeps you from being
productive.</p>
<p>Following Scrum blindly teaches you to follow the plan over
responding to change. Being agile is about trying out different options,
failing fast, and adapting quickly in an aim to deliver working
software. Above everything, it is the <em>results</em> that matter, not
the process.</p>
<h2 id="solution-2-start-with-the-end-in-mind.">Solution #2 —Start with
the end in mind.</h2>
<p>Too much change is as bad as no change at all, which is why it is
good to standardize things that do work. For the founders of Scrum, a
set sprint duration worked. That doesn’t mean that it is going to work
for you, especially when you are still finding your rhythm, though and
it is valuable advice to attempt to level out the effort in a repeatable
rhythm.</p>
<p>Use the Scrum Guide as a tried-and-tested recipe, but focus on the
end-goal rather than the process, and take it with a pinch of salt.
Don’t be a blind follower of Scrum, try it, change it, see what works
and what doesn’t and find your own recipe.</p>
<p>Constantly re-evaluate whether what used to work before is still the
best way to do things, with the understanding that you know more each
sprint and each sprint has different goals, requiring different
strategies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do it because it makes sense and it works. Not because the Scrum
Guide says so.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reason-3-velocity-is-just-a-number.">Reason #3 — Velocity is
just a number.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a saying in Quality Management that “What gets measured gets
done”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in fact the key to getting results that you want as any good
Quality Manager would know. By focusing on the measure you want to see
you, you inevitably reach those targets. The one thing to understand
however is that once you’ve reached these targets, they should be
reviewed and changed as the problem invariably has shifted for it to
remain valuable.</p>
<p>Quality is about remaining in equilibrium throughout the
organization. There is little use in developing fast but not able to
release. So too there is little value in being able to deliver fast but
not getting good quality code to release. It’s a false sense of
improvement.</p>
<p>The point I’m trying to make is that a measure is only as good as
long as it’s valuable and it only remains valuable for as long as it
reflects the bottleneck or weakest link in the system.</p>
<p>Viewing velocity as a reflection of relative productivity of the team
is setting you up for failure. When each sprint the velocity goes up,
most probably all it reflects is that the team is getting more cunning
at hacking the system. Most probably estimations will get higher,
stories will get smaller and bugs moved to another sprint rather than
more work being done.</p>
<h2 id="solution-3-measure-what-makes-sense.">Solution #3 — Measure what
makes sense.</h2>
<p>In reality, a team has an optimal productivity rate and it is
unrealistic to expect them each sprint to get faster and faster. Agility
is not about being <em>faster</em>, it is about responding to
<em>change</em> faster and focusing on the <em>right</em> work, not
<em>busy</em> work. When you rush to get work done, you often end up
realizing after it has been done that it was the wrong work and that
something else was more important.</p>
<p>Measure what makes sense and what is important. Now. And then change
it. Spend more time to think what the problem is and what success would
look like.</p>
<p><em>When too many impediments are the biggest problem, measure that.
When that problem is more under control, start uncovering the next
problem and measure that.</em></p>
<h2 id="reason-4-scrum-is-not-a-competition.">Reason #4 —Scrum is not a
competition.</h2>
<p>Scrum was born in the development environment, encouraging friendly
competition between different teams to be the best (although, in all
fairness, not intentionally driven by Scrum but part of human nature).
It excluded other parts of the organization and still does to a large
extent.</p>
<p>Even the use of the word “Scrum” implies a head-on-head collision
between two competing teams with the desire for one to win and the other
to loose.</p>
<p>While this can be beneficial in some cases, it also fragments the
organization into distinct pieces that tries to be better than the
other. The mostly unintended result of this is that teams subtly
sabotage other teams by refraining to share knowledge or help other
teams reach their goals in a fear that they will not be the ‘winning
team’ if they do.</p>
<p>I once worked in a large company with different development teams
with one team having a really bad reputation for not completing work and
when they do, it is usually filled with errors. Although inside the
organization everyone viewed this team as the cause of all the issues,
in reality, the entire organization’s reputation suffered as a result.
The customers didn’t care that one team was responsible for the back-end
and another for the front-end. They care about working software, and
when one part doesn’t work, the entire system is perceived as not
working.</p>
<h2 id="solution-4-focus-on-flow.">Solution #4 —Focus on Flow.</h2>
<p>You are as weak as your weakest link. The entire company suffers when
one team doesn’t perform at their potential productivity. There are no
winners and losers in the big picture as shown in this fictitious
scenario depicting the time spent on taking a customer need from
inception to delivered.</p>
<p><img
src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vZ2kgImkxwU0uyP6UHq0TQ.png" /></p>
<p>Focus on the entire flow of the system as a whole and on improving
the <em>flow</em>, not one team’s velocity.</p>
<p>Reduce lead time and waiting time rather than trying to develop
faster. In most organizations, it’s not the developers causing the lead
time to be long, it’s often the key stakeholders unable to make
decisions, or requirements not being adequate, or even infrastructure
not able to handle continuous integration. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Measure the lead time from idea to live in production per story and
aim to reduce this measure rather than optimizing the already working
parts.</p>
<h2 id="reason-5-customer-collaboration-and-the-role-of-the-po">Reason
#5 — Customer Collaboration and the role of the PO</h2>
<p>A criticism I have for both the XP and Scrum evangelists are the
importance that is often placed on the PO having to be available to
answer any questions the developers might have during the sprint.</p>
<p>Again, this is not mandated by Scrum explicitly, yet more often than
not seen in the agile transformations as there is a lot of emphasis in
the Scrum Guide placed on the actual artifacts and measures, not the
relationships and the collaborations.</p>
<p>The Scrum Guide doesn’t contain any section dedicated on customer
collaboration or relationships. Understandably, as mostly this is
implied and hard to articulate in words as it depends on so much, but
invariably this causes the focus of many Scrum implementations only to
be on the process, roles and artifacts and not the relationships.</p>
<p>Remember, every moment the PO spends with the developers is a moment
that they are not collaborating with the customer. The less they
collaborate with the customer, the less likely the PO will be in solving
the right problem.</p>
<h2 id="solution-5-relationships-first.">Solution #5 — Relationships
first.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Success relies 100% on relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s close to impossible to build a great product when the designer
and the developer doesn’t want to speak to each other or the Product
Owner is too scared to question the customer and challenge their
requests.</p>
<p>More than anything, the soft skills like communication, conflict
resolution and negotiation are the indicators of how fast a team can
produce something without having to redo it. Spending time to build
relationships might not feel productive, but the cost of not having good
relations within a team and between the team and the customer is the
number one reason for customers looking for alternatives or the wrong
software being developed.</p>
<p>Focus on the items in the Scrum Guideline, but don’t exclude the
importance of relationships.</p>
<p>And the PO is not a dedicated resource that should be available at
all times to the developers. They should spend equal or more time with
the customers than what they do with the developers.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Scrum is good. It might even be the golden bullet you’ve been looking
for. But just like no one medicine is the anti-dote to all illness, so
too no one methodology or framework is the solution to every
organization’s problems.</p>
<p><strong>Please <em>don’t</em> just Scrum on.</strong> Question
whether it works for you and try new things. Fail fast. Learn from your
mistakes, cultivating a culture of Kaizen. And most importantly, focus
on the relationships. Healthy relationships are a far bigger success
factor than most others.</p>

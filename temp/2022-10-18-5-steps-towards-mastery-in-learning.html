<h1 class="title">5 Steps Towards Mastery In Learning</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Learning is a process, not an event.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obtaining a certification marks the start of your journey towards
mastery of any subject. Yet in many organizations it is marked as the
achievement of a goal. As one of the most essential resources in a
corporate environment to keep employees happy, and an expensive
investment for the company, it is in the best interest of both the
employer and the employee that a return on investment is evident to
quantify the value of the newly learnt skill.</p>
<p>This post is dedicated to explore the five steps of mastering any
subject in a training program, following a previous post to outline the
learning process.</p>
<p>In summary, the learning process is a three-phase process starting
with becoming aware of what you don’t know. Initially you are all
excited but soon after you leave the classroom, the knowledge starts to
phase, unless you continue onto the second phase, which is habit
building. Finally, you reach a point where you want to give up and leave
everything for a while, and on your return suddenly it is easy and you
reach mastery.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 steps explained in succeeding in your corporate
training program.</p>
<h1 id="step-1-be-aware-of-the-learning-process">Step 1 — Be Aware Of
The Learning Process</h1>
<p>The most important part of mastering anything is knowing what is
involved and what the outcomes will be. That is why we like to have a
curriculum and exam, and that is how we know when we reach our goal.</p>
<p>Simply knowing that training shouldn’t stop once you’ve received your
certification will already allow you to work towards mastery without you
having to do anything. Simply reading this post will already help you on
your way to mastery, but it is up to you to take the next steps.</p>
<p>In the corporate environment it is imperative for the team leader to
allocate the necessary resources for people to continue their learning
once they return from a training program or certification. Don’t only
plan for the training, plan for the learning that follows the
training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The certification is the start, not the end of learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="step-2-clarify-the-training-outcome">Step 2 — Clarify The
Training Outcome</h1>
<p>This sounds obvious, but in most environments I’ve been in, there
were never tangible outcomes for training programs defined. People are
sent on training because they heard other people having successes with
the same certification, not because they had a specific problem in mind
to solve. That is keeping up with the Jones’ and it doesn’t make much
business sense, except to look cool and be able to socially connect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you want to change in your organization as a result of the
training? What are your business objectives and what behaviors do you
want to see change?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the problems you are trying to solve? Training is always as
a result of solving a problem, but mostly the training only addresses
part of the solution.</p>
<p>Quantify the return on investment, and explicity specify what you
want people to do with the knowledge. For an example of how I do it, you
can look at a <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7rhi79rwkjjf5yq/ECC%20Improvements%20Proposal.pdf?dl=0">proposal
for a learning centre</a> I recently did. Slide 9 and 10 contains the
business objectives and the target behaviors for this specific
problem.</p>
<h1 id="step-3-admit-to-where-you-are">Step 3 — Admit To Where You
Are</h1>
<p>Like a GPS not being able to direct you to your destination without
first knowing where you currently are, if you you are not honest about
where you are in terms of skills and abilities, you will not benefit
from a training program in the same sense as when you admit your
weaknesses.</p>
<p>Most people are however afraid to say that they don’t know something,
and employers are helpless to empower an individual if they don’t ask
for help or admit that they don’t know the answer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, employees are afraid to admit that they don’t know
because they fear the repercussions of being perceived as incompetent by
their employer.</p>
<p>But without honestly admitting your current state or the state of
your employees, you will not be able to progress and the gap between
where you are and where you want to be will just get bigger and training
won’t help much as it will either be the wrong training, or too hard or
easy.</p>
<h1 id="step-4-integrate-the-knowledge">Step 4 — Integrate the
Knowledge</h1>
<p>This is essentially phase 2 of the learning process summarised above,
where the newly acquired skills are applied in the workplace using a
trial and error approach.</p>
<p>The biggest pitfall to be aware of during this phase is not to bite
off more than you can chew.</p>
<p>Rather take one aspect of the training, like introducing standup
meetings when implementing Scrum, and get it right before you move on,
than implement everything half. It is better to learn one thing properly
than 10 things half.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like learning to juggle, you start simple and increase the
complexity and difficulty one step at a time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get the team to understand the purpose of what they are doing. In the
example of implementing Scrum standups, first focus on stimulating
movement (kinesthetic learning) in the team. Next start focusing on the
purpose of increased focus of time-boxed and short meetings, and once
the team is good at this, focus on breeding responsibility, autonomy and
pro-activity rather than reactivity.</p>
<h1 id="step-5-rest-and-restoration">Step 5 — Rest and Restoration</h1>
<p>One of the most neglected parts in any organization I’ve worked at is
the time allowed for rest and restoration. But just like machinery needs
downtime for maintenance, so our brains also need time to recover after
an intense learning session.</p>
<p>When you skip this step, you risk burning out the team, and you will
most definitely see a reduction in learning and productivity over time.
Like pouring water through a funnel, pouring more water is not going to
fill up the bottle faster, it is simply going to waste water spilling
over.</p>
<p>Use the rest period to reflect on the completed learning and start
setting goals for what is needed next, but in a relaxed environment
without any deadlines or must-do tasks. Have an informal discussion over
coffee, or even better, while walking down the beach to find out how
effective the training was and how it helped the organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Celebrate your successes, and share it with the team.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Learning is a process, obtaining a degree or certification is an
event at the start of the learning process.</p>
<p>In order to master any field, you need to allow your team to
integrate the newly acquired skills following a process of trying and
failing, until it becomes easier, and until your problem you set out to
alleviate, is resolved.</p>
<p>In order to speed up, you first however need to slow down. Effective
learning is not about how fast or how much training you complete, but
how flexible you are in applying your knowledge to different
problems.</p>

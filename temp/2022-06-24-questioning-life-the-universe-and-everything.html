    "description": "A practical guide to ensemble programming (mob programming), explaining why it works, how to get started, and how it improves quality, learning, and team relationships.",
    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

<h1 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h1>
<p><em>Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth it?</em></p>
<p><em>Is the investment you make in your friends worth it?</em> Do you
get a return on your investment? Can you rely on them in times of need?
Will they still love you when you’re at your worst — angry, or poor, or
ugly, or fat — or maybe dating someone from a different culture than
you?</p>
<p><em>Is the car you drive worth the inconvenience</em> of being stuck
in traffic, having to stop to fill up with petrol, renewing licenses and
taking it for a service every so often? Is having it adding more to your
quality of life than the inconveniences and costs it brings? Does the
joy — both material and emotional — outweigh the cost of having it?</p>
<p>Or are you just used to it and can’t imagine your life without
it?</p>
<p><em>Is the money you pay in order to buy “stuff” to keep up with the
Jones’ in a hope to find happiness worth it?</em> Is it worth the fancy
clothes, the newest tech, the big house with all the empty rooms? Does
people really think you’re somehow worth more when you can show them the
glitter that modern day society values? Do you really think people will
like you more when you have more “stuff”?</p>
<p><em>Most importantly though, does it make you happy?</em></p>
<p>Is the sacrifice you make each day to earn just never enough money,
doing something that just doesn’t bring you as much joy as you wish, for
making someone else wealthy really worth it?</p>
<p>Is it worth spending the majority of your time with people you
wouldn’t choose to spend it with while the people you do wish to spend
time with is with the nanny or at school — away from the very thing they
need most — namely parental love? Is it worth working long hours so that
you can buy them a fancy toy for their birthday while in fact they like
the box and sitting on your lap unwrapping it more than the toy itself?
Is it worth worth sacrificing time with your loved ones?</p>
<p>Is it worth buying that <em>thing</em> on Amazon at the lowest price
so that the seller makes just enough to scrape by while Jeff Bezos
stopped counting his wealth years ago, unable to spend it all even if he
wished.</p>
<p>Is it worth looking up to Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and any other power
figure today when all they teach us is that it will <em>never</em> be
enough? No matter how much you have, you obsessively need <em>more</em>.
Like a virus consuming the very host they live on, always looking for
<em>more</em> to fill the hole in their soul.</p>
<p>Is it worth believing that any <em>thing —</em> be it money, power,
fame or anything else — will fill that hole in your soul like mainstream
media proclaims to be true? Is it worth believing that when you have all
the power you will get the one thing you desire above all — to be loved
and accepted? How many authoritarian rulers have been loved by their
people in the past? Why would you believe that <em>this</em> time it
will be different?</p>
<p>Is it worth believing what the media, the government, your friends
and family say you should think and believe while deep down you know
it’s not in alignment with your true self? Is it worth blindly trusting
people who hasn’t been through what you’ve been through, and who doesn’t
know your deepest yearnings or what will make you happy? Do you really
think they know what’s in your best interest when their lives are in all
aspects so different to yours?</p>
<p>Is it worth investing in someone else’s dream because somehow you
believe your dream isn’t possible?</p>
<p><strong><em>What if it was possible?</em></strong> Would you still
make the same choices?</p>
<p>Is it worth avoiding the pain of truth when by avoiding it you trap
yourself inside the pain, keeping you safe from pain but also from love?
Doomed to experience the same painful experience over and over and over
and over again like Groundhog Day until you break down the walls. Until,
finally, you’re willing to question your beliefs and find what is true
to you?</p>
<p>Until finally, you’re willing to face your own shadows and sit with
your pain like it was a little child? Not pushing it away or trying to
pretend it isn’t there or valid?</p>
<p>Is it worth living an empty life stripped from emotion and connection
in return for predictability and a perceived stability? Is it worth
believing the lies you keep telling yourself just so that you don’t have
to feel the discomfort of the truth?</p>
<p>Is it worth forcing your beliefs onto others, while refusing to hear
<em>their</em> point of view in a hope that somehow, someday, people
will see <em>your</em> point of view? Is it worth getting angry when
someone challenges your beliefs because you’re afraid of who you’ll be
if what you believed wasn’t true anymore?</p>
<p>What if it <em>was</em> true? But what if it doesn’t have to be true
anymore?</p>
<p><strong><em>What if you could choose differently?</em></strong></p>
<p>What if you didn’t need to suffer anymore?</p>
<p>Is it worth pretending everything is going ok and under control when
the wheels are clearly falling off the cart for everyone to see? Is it
worth believing the lies that the media tells us that the economy is
doing just fine when in fact a collapse is on the cards?</p>
<p>Is it worth believing that the government is there to serve the
people when they rule in an authoritarian way, abusing the very power
given to them?</p>
<p>Is it worth believing either presidential candidate won any election
based on merit the past decade, maybe longer? Is it worth believing in
the fantasy of the president who will save all their citizens while in
fact all they care about is winning the next election and getting more
votes? The only difference between the 2020 US presidential and other
elections is that with this one the corruption was seen whereas
previously is was hidden.</p>
<p>Is it worth believing in the promises that just never seem to come to
fruition? Always with a new, valid, reason, and each time with bigger,
newer promises, just to hear yet another excuse as to why it couldn’t be
done next round? Always asking for <em>more</em> money, <em>more</em>
resources, <em>more</em> time? Like the virus never satiated until
there’s nothing left?</p>
<p>Would you, if you were the owner of a company, allow employees to
always postpone delivering a project? Why do we allow that with
government? Aren’t they there to serve the people? Aren’t the people the
ones paying for them to be there in the first place?</p>
<p>Is it worth killing literally thousands of businesses to keep people
safe from a virus but then letting them starve from hunger, unable to
provide for their family?</p>
<p>Is it worth believing that <em>this</em> time it will be different,
when it hasn’t been different in the history of humanity? Is it worth
believing that if only we hold onto the broken systems a little longer
and pour <em>more</em> money and resources into it that it will suddenly
start to work better? When in reality our needs have changed so much
that it doesn’t serve them in the first place. Is it really worth
holding on to the past?</p>
<p><em>Is it worth postponing your happiness by avoiding the
truth?</em></p>
<p>Is it worth ignoring your inner compass just to keep bumping your
head on the wall while listening to someone else’s directions?</p>
<p><strong><em>You’re worth it as you are.</em></strong></p>
<p>You were perfectly worthy the day you were born — naked and unable to
do anything for yourself — you’re even <em>more</em> worthy today. You
don’t need the car, the house, the fancy clothes, the followers, the
money, the power. All you need is to discover your unique gift to the
world. That special thing that no-one else can do as good as you.</p>
<p><em>Do you believe in you?</em></p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>No two people are the same. Each person born on this earth is unique
and has a purpose. It’s up to you to find yours.</p>
<p>Go on, find you.</p>
<p>Listen to your heart and use your head to make it a reality. Have the
courage to admit to your pain. Have the courage to feel it and little by
little uncover the diamond beneath it.</p>
<p>You can <em>always</em> choose differently. Your past doesn’t define
who you are to become if you don’t let it. Do you want to repeat the
past mistakes? Or do you have the courage to move forward?</p>

<p><em>10 Rules to agility success</em></p>
<p>Whenever you think of agile, the first word that comes up for most
people is Scrum. Born in the late 80’s and formalized in 1995, <a
href="http://www.scrumguides.org/history.html">Scrum</a> was the
fore-runner of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile
Manifesto</a>, which was also co-created with the founders of Scrum.</p>
<p>It’s thus natural that when you talk about agile, Scrum comes up.
Yet, more often than not, I wonder whether people realize the perfection
of this framework and why it works so well. I keep hearing the same
complaints and the same questions when new organizations decide to
embark on an agile transformation.</p>
<p>The most common of these complaints are asking for a manual or book,
as the lightweight 17 page <a
href="http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf">Scrum
Guide</a> simply doesn’t contain enough information to succeed. With so
many books on the subject to choose from, for a newbie, this is a huge
challenge.</p>
<p>And that is exactly the beauty of agile and Scrum, and each time I
hear this complaint I think to myself that it’s exactly the point! As
the whole methodology is one of learning rather than doing. It’s about
creating a learning organization, one who is able to make good judgement
calls. Having a manual would be way too restrictive, and it would
contradict the essence of the methodology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — Clare Boothe Luce</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes Scrum most enticing to me, is it’s simplicity. It’s a
lightweight 17 pages consolidating everything you need for a successful
agile implementation. The <a
href="http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf">Scrum
Guide</a> starts off with in the this in the definition of Scrum,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…it’s simple to understand, it’s difficult to master…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, few organizations seem to get it right. Indeed difficult to
master if so many people struggle with the same issue.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-are-they-struggling">But <em>why</em> are they
struggling?</h2>
<p>The most common complaint for new implementations that I’ve seen to
date is the lack of reference guides on how to implement Scrum. The
Scrum guide itself doesn’t contain enough flesh to be used as a manual
for implementation without a coach, yet, if you do invest in an agile
coach to help you with the transition, you can either get lucky by
getting one of the many brilliant coaches out there, or not, as the
industry is littered with certifications focused only on the technical
skills.</p>
<p>Selecting your agile coach isn’t as easy and straightforward as
choosing for example a team lead or a project manager. What you are
looking for is not technical skills (although those are important too),
but an agile <em>mindset</em>.</p>
<p>Once you understand <em>why</em> Scrum works so well, transitioning
becomes much easier, giving more options and room for play with the
implementation. Thus, improving your chances to succeed
substantially.</p>
<h1 id="a-scrum-mindset-cheat-sheet">A Scrum Mindset Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>At the heart of agile is creating a culture of learning, thus I
embarked on a year-long education-focused gap-year to experiment with
what makes learning effective, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>I realized that Scrum already incorporate all these things, which is
why it works so well, with the only exception that it doesn’t provide
options to keep it interesting. It only contains one sample of each of
the required methods, and people follow these blindly until they start
getting bored with it.</p>
<p>Which brings me to crucial element number one.</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-keep-it-interesting">Rule # 1 Keep it interesting</h2>
<p>Scrum and it’s practices works so well, because it’s like a breath of
fresh air in the organization if you’re used to waterfall. You’re doing
exactly the same things as before, but you’re doing it slightly, or
sometimes very, different.</p>
<p>You’re still writing requirements, but they’re more fun and have more
context because they’re done in a different manner. Standup meetings
suddenly is a relief from the boring round table sessions, sticky-notes
are colorful and grabs attention.</p>
<p>Trying to engage a bunch of rowdy 8 year’s taught me probably the
most important rule of education.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you don’t have their attention, and if they’re not relaxed,
you’re wasting your time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which also nicely leads to the second crucial element of a successful
business, let alone agile transition.</p>
<h2 id="rule-2-provide-a-safe-environment">Rule #2 Provide a safe
environment</h2>
<p>One of the main goals of scrum is to have autonomous teams, teams who
report to <em>each other</em>, not to a Scrum Master or a manager.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why this is extremely important, but mostly,
if you’re not relaxed and confident to speak up in a team setting,
you’re likely to make mistakes.</p>
<p>In an autonomous team, there is no pressure to impress your boss to
get the promotion or raise that you want, and there is much less risk of
being told that your idea is unwelcome or crazy. If everyone is on the
same hierarchical level, it immediately creates a safe environment where
each individual’s input is as important and valued as it’s peer.</p>
<p>In a safe environment you are relaxed, and when you’re relaxed you
can focus on the task at hand, not on strategies how to avoid punishment
or look better than your team mate.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-stimulate-different-learning-styles">Rule # 3 Stimulate
different learning styles</h2>
<p><em>People are sensual beings, and they learn better the more senses
are stimulated.</em> Our traditional classroom-style teaching puts
emphasis on only auditory learners (learning by listening) with some
visual stimulation (learning by seeing) when using the white-board or
slides in the training.</p>
<p><em>The most important part of learning, however (according to me
that is), namely kinesthetic learning (learning by moving or doing), is
mostly neglected. Scrum includes this part of learning with it’s
standup’s and requiring people to stand up and move and touch sticky
notes on a board in standups, planning sessions and
retrospectives.</em></p>
<p>Most learning methodologies believe that you are primarily dominant
in one of these, and although I agree with that, I believe that optimal
learning can only be achieved when all three are stimulated.</p>
<p>Making the learning even more efficient would also include the
olfactory (sense of smell) and gustatory (sense of taste) senses to
anchor what has been learned.</p>
<p>The ritual adapted by some Scrum teams to bring snacks to the
Retrospective addresses this and helps to anchor behaviors in the team.
The question is whether these are healthy or dysfunctional behaviors
being anchored.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-visualize-information">Rule #4 Visualize information</h2>
<p>Software development is mostly intangible. It’s the art of
translating abstract thought into functional systems, using a
computer.</p>
<p>When you can’t see something, however, it becomes very difficult to
manage it, as you can’t see the obstacles, unless the person
experiencing the obstacle says something about it. Visualizing
information is key to firstly awareness, and secondly process
improvement.</p>
<p>The <strong>Scrum Board</strong> is one way that information can be
visualized. Kanban and Lean uses different methods of visualization, yet
they all have one thing in common — everything important, is stuck
somewhere on a wall.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-provides-focus">Rule #5 Provides Focus</h2>
<p>The entire Scrum method is built to allow teams to focus on a
specific goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the people who multitask the most just can’t focus.”<br />
― Jeff Sutherland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>planning session</strong> is designed to allow all the
role players to be in the same room while you plan the sprint ahead,
without any distractions. The <strong>sprint</strong> itself is a
container helping the team to focus on a specific sprint goal, and the
<strong>retrospective</strong> clearly dedicates time to focus on
learning, and how this learning can be integrated to improve the next
round of development.</p>
<p>The <strong>backlog</strong> is another example of creating focus in
the team as well as the organization, and each <strong>daily
standup</strong> is intended to focus the team members’ efforts on their
daily tasks to ensure they will stay on track towards the sprint goal,
and ultimately the product road map and vision.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-no-end-point">Rule #6 No end point</h2>
<p>Traditional project management clearly plans for each project to have
a definitive start and end, and maintenance teams or operations are
mostly separate division, removed from the development team.</p>
<p>That implies that you only have one chance to get it right, but it
also separates the learning from the development. Where each reported
customer issue is an opportunity to better understand the needs and
react, separating development from maintenance broadens the gap between
the product and the customer, and it splits the ownership of the
code.</p>
<p>Scrum, on the other hand, is designed to continuously grow and
evolve, much like a tree. The product keeps on growing, with each sprint
an opportunity to align with the customer’s changed requirements. Each
sprint the team knows the customers and the customer’s needs more, and
is better able to fulfill these needs.</p>
<p>The goal is a vision that keeps changing, and each sprint only
focuses on taking one step to get closer to the goal. When the goal
changes, there is no big impact, as you only need to adjust one step,
not an entire journey.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7-makes-fair-judgement-calls">Rule #7 Makes fair judgement
calls</h2>
<p>The entire agile manifesto, Scrum to a lesser degree, is designed
around the concept of judgment and decision making. Each time you do
something in Scrum, whether it is estimating the effort, selecting or
creating user stories, or choosing a task, you are expected to make a
judgement call.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a constant weighing of factors in order to make the best
decision with the information and resources that you have at hand now,
knowing that tomorrow you will know more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules, processes and procedures. Rather,
there are objectives that need to be met and guidelines and best
practices. Each time you deliver , you need to way up these factors to
decide how best to meet your objectives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals and interactions <strong><em>over</em></strong> processes
and tools<br />
Working software <strong><em>over</em></strong> comprehensive
documentation<br />
Customer collaboration <strong><em>over</em></strong> contract
negotiation<br />
Responding to change <strong><em>over</em></strong> following a plan</p>
<p>It’s all about decision making, and how you make decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One sprint it might be more important to document the release notes
carefully to limit support calls from customers on how to use a new
feature. The next sprint an emergency fix might need to be rolled out,
requiring the team to spend all the effort in managing the risk, rather
than write documentation, and they will rather phone the customers than
write a release note. Yet another sprint, the team might focus on
refactoring, updating the architecture and deciding to document the
model (or not).</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, the decision will be different, and each
sprint, you will know more than the previous one, thus each sprint you
need to ask whether what you did the previous sprint is still the best
way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="rule-8-provide-context">Rule #8 Provide context</h2>
<p>What was missing in most of the waterfall methodologies, was that
each requirement and each function were so granular and specialized,
that the overall context were often forgotten. Often times a really good
feature was rolled out, only to realize that it is for the wrong
customer, or doesn’t address the customers most urgent needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrum is designed to provide more context, which makes it easier to
deliver the right product, every time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team structure is intended to be
<strong>cross-funtional</strong>, <strong>self organizing
teams</strong>, implying that everything that needs to be done to
deliver are included in the story. No longer does the developer work in
isolation with a tester criticizing their work at the end of the
development lifecyle. Now the developer and tester work hand-in-hand to
take more viewpoints into consideration earlier in the development
process.</p>
<p><strong>User stories</strong> in Scrum is another example of
providing more context , where each requirement now explicitly includes
the end user it is intended for, and the value or benefit of this
requirement. This allows a developer more autonomy in designing a
technical solution, while being closer to the end-user, reminding them
constantly who the requirement is for.</p>
<h2 id="rule-9-enables-effective-learning">Rule #9 Enables effective
learning</h2>
<p>For learning to be effective, there needs to be three elements
present:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A clear purpose.</li>
<li>Room for exploration and experimenting with options.</li>
<li>Reviewing what has been learned, integrating the skill.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scrum includes all these elements in each sprint, starting at the
planning session, ending with the retrospective.</p>
<p>The <strong>sprint goal</strong> set at the planning session serves
as the purpose, with the <strong>user story</strong> and it’s acceptance
criteria purpose on a more granular level; the team selecting their
tasks (rather than being allocated a task), and the inclusion of
<strong>spikes</strong> and building <strong>prototypes</strong> allows
the team to experiment with different options; while the
<strong>review</strong> and <strong>retrospectives</strong> both allows
the team to review whether the goal was indeed met, and what could be
done better next time.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #10 Improved communication</strong></p>
<p>The biggest benefit of Scrum, more than anything else in my opinion,
is the design to improve communication throughout the team, as well as
throughout the organization.</p>
<p>The smaller, autonomous teams reporting to each other daily, the
inclusion of the Product Owner, and the focused rituals where team
members give input into the planning, while being given the opportunity
to discuss failures in a safe environment, all are designed to create an
environment for improved and effective communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Scrum provides an infrastructure that supports communication,
knowing that face-to-face communication is the most effective means of
communication.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 80% of communication is non-verbal, and <em>relying</em> on
tools and electronic communication such as Skype, Trello or Slack
instead of face-to-face communication, means that the message being
conveyed are possibly misunderstood or incomplete, which in turn means
lower quality development with more errors introduced, requiring more
time to develop the same requirements.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Scrum works. If it’s not working for you, evaluate whether your
implementation is meeting the rules of the game, as outlined in this
post.</p>
<p>The framework itself is a perfect model for agility. Understanding
<em>why</em> Scrum works, makes it possible to fill in the blanks tailor
made and suitable to your unique organization.</p>

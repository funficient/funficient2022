<p>Post the COVID pandemic of 2020 dismissals and lay-offs became a
frequent occurrence. Twitter, newly under the reign of Elon Musk, laid
off as much as 70% of the workforce over just a couple of months. While
Twitter was in the spotlight, most people, however, were affected by
someone close to them being laid off. Reducing costs by reducing the
headcount has been a common management strategy for years. It is also a
very orange approach. But how do organizations operating from a teal
paradigm handle dismissals? This post explores dismissals and how teal
organizations handle them.</p>
<p>Dismissals are handled very differently by ‘orange’ and ‘teal’
organizations.  It can be best described by the guiding metaphors that
represent the orange and teal paradigms. But first, let’s look at a
brief history of the evolution of organizations to put it into
perspective. If you want a more detailed summary, look at <a
href="https://funficient.substack.com/p/the-teal-chronicles">this
post</a> or read <a
href="https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/">Reinventing
Organizations</a> as a source of the model.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-evolution-of-organizations">A brief
history of the evolution of organizations</h2>
<p>The earliest identified development stage of humanity, spanning
roughly from 10,000 to 50,000 BC, is represented by the <em>reactive
infrared paradigm</em>, where there wasn’t any form of organizational
model yet. People lived in small family units and foraged for food. They
can be compared to a newborn infant who doesn’t yet see themselves as
separate from their mother and the world at large.</p>
<p>The next developmental phase, the <em>magic magenta paradigm</em>,
was when nomadic families shifted to larger groups, combining the
strength of different family units. As the world at large is not
understood, magic and pleasing the gods with rituals is how people make
sense of the world around them. At this stage, there are still no
organizations and it can be compared to a toddler.</p>
<h3 id="impulsive-red-the-wolf-pack">Impulsive Red – The Wolf Pack</h3>
<p>The first chiefdoms and empires emerged next, and from it the first
forms of organizational life. At this stage the ego is fully formed and
with that the sense of separation from the whole. This is a fear-based
paradigm typically seen in mafia gangs.</p>
<p>For the first time division of labor within a hierarchy emerged. The
guiding metaphor is the <em>“wolf pack”</em> where the alpha maintains
his power by force. The main benefit of this stage is that the group is
highly adaptive to outside threats and chaotic environments, for
example, combat situations.</p>
<h3 id="conformist-amber-the-army-church">Conformist Amber – The Army /
Church</h3>
<p>The next breakthrough came with the <em>conformist amber</em>
paradigm. For the first time, people could project into the future and
agriculture, for example, emerged. Rather than only reacting to the
immediate situations, forward planning and with that discipline
emerged.</p>
<p>The guiding metaphor for this stage is “The army” where formal roles
and processes bring with it stability and scalable hierarchies. For the
first time, this is a long-term perspective.</p>
<h3 id="achievement-orange-the-machine">Achievement Orange – The
Machine</h3>
<p>The next phase, the <em>achievement orange</em> paradigm, made a
major leap in societal development. The main <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/05/12/worldview/">worldview</a>
is scientific and for the first time, people started questioning
authority. The key breakthroughs this paradigm brought is the concept of
meritocracy, accountability, and innovation.</p>
<p>The scientific worldview aimed at understanding the parts of the
system that formed the organization as a machine. We typically talk
about inputs, outputs, efficiency, moving the needle, hitting the
breaks, re-engineering, human resources, and blueprints. We see the
organization as a machine. The world at large is a zero-sum game where
the winner takes all. Most large organizations today operate from this
paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="pluralistic-green-the-family">Pluralistic Green – The
Family</h3>
<p>The next phase of development is the green worldview where for the
first time there is more to life than work.  Organizations are highly
sensitive to people’s feelings. They seek equity and fairness and place
emphasis on social needs and culture.</p>
<p>The guiding metaphor is <em>“the family”</em> with the key
breakthroughs that emerged in individual empowerment, the stakeholder
model and values-driven cultures.</p>
<h3 id="evolutionary-teal-the-living-organism">Evolutionary Teal – The
Living Organism</h3>
<p>Finally, we arrive at the evolutionary teal worldview that sees the
organization as a living organism. It brings with it a systems approach,
taking the parts mastered in the orange phase and turning them into a
system where the impact and interaction with the world outside the
organization are taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Striving for wholeness, purpose, and self-management are the key
breakthroughs this paradigm brings to organizational development.</p>
<p>From this vantage point, it is clear to see that you can’t skip a
level of development. It values each developmental phase, realizing that
without caterpillars consuming the green leaves of your garden there
would be no butterflies.</p>
<p>With this greater understanding of organizational evolution, let’s
look at the characteristics of how organizations handle dismissals in
the two main paradigms, without judgment.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-dismissals-in-orange-organizations">Characteristics
of dismissals in orange organizations</h2>
<p>Organizations operating mainly from an orange paradigm view an
organization as a machine. When a part in a machine doesn’t function as
desired, it is simply replaced. The orange worldview handles dismissals
in a similar way. Here are the main characteristics of these
organizations:</p>
<h3 id="the-boss-has-the-authority-to-dismiss">1. The Boss has the
authority to dismiss</h3>
<p>In an organization operating primarily from an orange paradigm,
bosses have the authority to hire and fire as they deem fit.</p>
<p>Dismissals are not seen as personal, but rather a logical decision
focusing on the efficiency of the overall machine. There is typically
little to no emotional connection when deciding to dismiss someone.</p>
<h3 id="dismissal-is-mostly-a-legal-and-financial-process">2. Dismissal
is mostly a legal and financial process</h3>
<p>To expand on this machine worldview, a dismissal is mostly a legal
and financial process. With a drive for achievement and efficiency,
cutting costs is simply seen as a means to ensure the organization’s
survival.</p>
<h2
id="characteristics-of-dismissals-in-teal-organizations">Characteristics
of dismissals in teal organizations</h2>
<p>Organizations operating mainly from a teal paradigm view an
organization as a living organism. When a part of the system doesn’t
function as intended, healing is attempted, as with the human body.</p>
<p>If, for example, you have a heart problem, you attempt to heal it
first. Only as a last resort will you replace the faulty organ.
Dismissals are handled in a similar way. Here are the main
characteristics of how teal organizations handle dismissals.</p>
<h3 id="mediated-conflict-management">1. Mediated conflict
management</h3>
<p>In a typical teal organization, there is no hierarchy.  Therefore, no
boss can decide who to fire or hire. Any discord in the team or
organization initiates a conflict management process.</p>
<p>Viewing the organization as a living organism, any issue initiates a
mediated conflict management process. The goal is always to find a
mutually beneficial solution to the problem.</p>
<h3 id="dismissal-is-the-last-resort">2. Dismissal is the last
resort</h3>
<p>Dismissals are a last resort if the conflict resolution process fails
to resolve the issue.  Issues are typically addressed when they are
still small with a win-win outcome desired.</p>
<p>A teal approach to conflict management might look like this simple <a
href="https://medium.com/@hugomlopes/lets-stop-managing-conflicts-4aff363361ea">four-step
process</a> where at first you take a look at yourself and how you might
change before you address it directly with the person.  If the issue
remains only do you call in a mediator and as a last resort an outside
decider that might result in dismissal.</p>
<h3 id="support-the-dismissed">2. Support the dismissed</h3>
<p>In a conscious living organism where every part is seen as useful and
needed, it’s not possible to cut out a part without also feeling the
pain.</p>
<p>When a decision results in a dismissal, they are supported in the
transition and even helped to find another role. This might look like
having coaching conversations and other types of feedback sessions to
increase their self-awareness. The dismissal becomes a learning
opportunity where the dismissed person has an opportunity to increase
their <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2019/05/25/self-awareness-workplace/">self-awareness</a>
and emotional intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="getting-from-orange-to-teal">Getting from orange to teal</h2>
<p>Moving from ‘orange’ to ‘teal’ mostly involves developing more
responsible team members and managing expectations better. Here is a
rough guide to get from orange to teal:</p>
<h3 id="manage-expectations-pro-actively">1. Manage expectations
pro-actively</h3>
<p>Prevention is better than cure. Rather than having to get to the
point where you have to dismiss people, focus on preventative measures.
This starts at the recruitment phase by being very clear about your
expectations, including desired values and behaviours.</p>
<p>Whenever a new hire doesn’t meet expectations and when the issue is
still small, immediately address it directly in a non-confrontational
way to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore any issue hoping it will disappear. Confront it head-on
and honestly, be clear about what the problem is, as well as what you
would rather have happen. Also, be explicit about the consequences if it
happens again.</p>
<p>Most people would gladly change their behaviours or up-skill in an
area if they were included in a dismissal decision. Including a coaching
strategy in your organization can also help in changing both behaviours
and skills by giving people the tools to solve their weaknesses.</p>
<h3 id="define-a-conflict-resolution-process">2. Define a conflict
resolution process</h3>
<p>No matter how proactive you are, however, you may run into situations
where you have to dismiss someone. Define a conflict resolution process
and make it available to everyone.</p>
<p>Include consequences and escalation in the process. Aim for a
mutually beneficial solution as an outcome. The <a
href="https://trueclarity.wordpress.com/2012/06/23/an-evaporating-cloud-real-world-example/#:~:text=The%20Evaporating%20Cloud%20is%20a%20Thinking%20Process%20developed,you%20have%20two%20totally%20opposite%20points%20of%20view.">evaporating
clouds process</a> is an effective and simple example of how to resolve
conflict with a win-win outcome.</p>
<h3 id="identify-and-enable-mediators">3. Identify and enable
mediators</h3>
<p>While going through the conflict resolution process might resolve
most conflicts, in more extreme cases you might need a mediator. Train
people in mediation and make sure everyone knows who they can pull in
when needed to resolve a conflict.</p>
<h3 id="provide-support">4. Provide support</h3>
<p>When mediation and conflict resolution don’t resolve the issue,
create structures and processes that will provide adequate support to
help the person with their career transition. This could mean simply
having a conversation and asking them what they need. It could also
include coaching conversations or emotional support to prepare them for
the exit.</p>
<p>In a typical orange worldview organization people are simply severed
from the organization with no emotional attachment. It’s just business. 
In a teal paradigm, however, the goal is to make sure the person leaving
is supported and has the resources to allow them to find an alternative
position elsewhere. With a more long-term outlook, you never know who
this person might become in the future or when you might need them
again.</p>
<p>The goal is thus to leave on good terms where both agree it is best
for them.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-ready-for-teal">Are you ready for teal?</h2>
<p>Transitioning to a more teal way of operation doesn’t have to result
in chaos, and it doesn’t have to disrupt the status quo.  The question
is whether the pain of staying where you are is bigger than the pain of
trying something new.</p>

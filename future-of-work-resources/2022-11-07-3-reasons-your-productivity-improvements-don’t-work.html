    "articleBody": "This article introduces ensemble programming (also known as mob programming or mobbing), a collaborative practice where three or more people work together on the same problem, at the same time, on the same codebase. Drawing on principles from Extreme Programming (XP), lean thinking, and real-world team experience, it explains why ensemble programming improves software quality, learning, focus, and team relationships.\n\nUsing the metaphor of a jazz band, the article explores how shared flow, real-time feedback, and multiple perspectives turn individual skill into collective outcomes that no one could create alone. It outlines the key benefits of ensemble programming, including reduced waiting time, fewer defects, improved onboarding, better communication, and increased resilience by avoiding knowledge silos.\n\nThe article then provides a practical, beginner-friendly guide to getting started with ensemble programming. It covers essential roles such as driver and navigator, the importance of regular rotation, ideal group size, task selection, supporting tools, voluntary participation, and the role of reflection through retrospectives. The focus is on creating sustainable, human-centered collaboration rather than maximizing individual output.\n\nOverall, the article positions ensemble programming as a powerful practice for modern, remote, and knowledge-based teams that want to improve quality, learning, and trust while building stronger relationships and shared ownership.",

          Traditional onboarding (“orange paradigm”) overwhelms new hires with administrative tasks and role silos. Teal onboarding shifts the focus to culture, relationships, and systems thinking through just-in-time information, rotational exposure, and mentoring. The result is faster integration, stronger engagement, and a foundation for continuous improvement and self-managed work.

<h2 id="unpacking-productivity">Unpacking productivity</h2>
<p>Productivity is the key to improve your quality of life. When you are
more productive, you have more time to do the things you <em>really</em>
want to be doing. The things that make you happy. The things that make
the grind-work bearable.</p> 
<p>Most people believe doing more, faster is the answer.  Yet, just like adding another lane on the highway doesn't alleviate the congestion, so too adding more bandwidth to your daily life doesn't mean you're more productive.  It might mean you are doing more in the same time, but what if what you're doing doesn't bring you any closer to where you want to be?  This post looks at the top three reasons most productivity improvement initiatives doesn't yield the desired results.</p>

<p>In business, for example, higher productivity means more sales which
ultimately results in higher profits. Higher profits mean you can pay
higher salaries, get more customers, and make more products to sell.
Additional to the obvious benefits though, there’s also the added
benefit of freeing up your most under-utilized, and most
expensive resource – namely human resources – to explore ways to make
your organization even more profitable in a positive snowball. Many of Google’s most loved
apps, including Gmail and Google Maps, for example, were born from <a class="external-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/google-employees-dedicate-20-percent-of-their-time-to-side-projects-heres-how-it-works.html">Google’s
20% innovation time</a> where employees were allowed 20% time to work on
a project of their choice, as long as it benefits the company.</p>
<p>In principle, this is an excellent idea, provided you are explicit about the direction of the company and what's most important.  However, when a business is struggling to deliver on their brand promise or not clear on the direction they want to move into, 20% innovation time can be a bad idea to start your productivity improvement drive. So what can you do right now to improve your productivity?</p>

<p>Finding a strategy towards a more effective way to improve your productivity becomes easy once you know what you're doing wrong. Below are the top 3 reasons your productivity improvements don’t work. </p>

<h2 id="youre-measuring-the-thing-wrong">1. You’re improving a part, not the whole</h2>
<p>One of the most popular myths around improving productivity is the belief that improving the efficiency of individual parts of the system improves the system's productivity. Leaders believe that by optimizing a specific function or team they will inadvertently improve the overall performance.</p>

<p> For example, in software development, productivity is often measured by the number of features delivered in a specific timeframe. Or in Scrum, velocity is the key measure of productivity. <a class="external-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/velocity/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~&#39;page~&#39;post~&#39;aa_book~&#39;aa_event_session~&#39;aa_experience_report~&#39;aa_glossary~&#39;aa_research_paper~&#39;aa_video)~tags~(~&#39;velocity))~searchTerm~&#39;~sort~false~sortDirection~&#39;asc~page~1)">The
velocity</a> is an indication of how many features (or stories, or outputs) were delivered in a specific time-box (or sprint). The higher the velocity, the more features are delivered, the more productive the system. But is it really more productive producing more?</p>

<p>What if these new features contain a lot of errors requiring the support team to handle a higher number of customer issues and require rework and bugfixes in a subsequent iteration? Or what if these features sit in a queue waiting to be deployed in the quarterly release increasing inventory and cost of storage without bringing in any value for the business, thus rendering it worthless? Or what if what you delivered isn’t what the customer wanted, resulting in time and resources ultimately wasted?</p>

<p class="center small-quote ">Are you really being more productive?</p>

<h3 id="the-missing-link">You're as weak as your weakest link</h3>
<p>There’s one critical flaw in the productivity calculation to measure improvements when you look at the efficiency of a part. It doesn’t compare apples with apples. A 10% improvement in the development process doesn't necessarily result in a 10% productivity
improvement of the whole system.</p>

<p>Without developed features deployed, and even more importantly - used - you might have increased the efficiency of a part, but the productivity of the whole is still
exactly the same, in some cases even worse as a result of the increased speed or increased waiting time between two different departments/business units.</p>

<p>To truly measure an improvement in productivity, you have to look at
the whole system within context of value produced. To understand the
improvement you need to obtain a baseline lead time from idea (or customer request) to
delivered and used, ultimately accepted as valuable by the end-user. Only when the lead time reduces can you say that your productivity have increased.  Your improvement is only productive when it moves you closer to a desired outcome.</p>

<p class="center small-quote">By improving the parts within the system you don't necessarily improve the whole system.  And without improving the whole system you're not improving at all.  </p>

<p>You’re as weak as your weakest link. To improve
productivity, an increase in efficiency in one area is not enough. You
also need to improve the interaction or handover between the different
parts each time you improve one part of the process to truly be more
productive.</p>

<p>Process improvement can only be truly measured from the point of view
of the customer. If the product or service doesn’t result in delivering
value faster to the customer, you’re not truly improving your
productivity.</p>

<h2 id="youre-measuring-the-wrong-thing">2. You’re measuring the wrong
thing</h2>

<p>As soon as you set a target, people will try their best to meet that
target. In quality there is a saying that goes <em>"What gets measured gets done."</em>.  Essentially, a measurement is a focus point that filters people's attention.  If you measure the wrong thing, people will focus on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Often, it looks like a right measure when looking at a part in
isolation, however, when looking at the whole it becomes clear the measure might not have the desired effect.  For example, a call center often measures productivity by aiming to decrease the call duration of support calls, and increasing the total number of support calls per agent.  On face value, this makes sense.  The more calls you can handle and the faster you can handle them, the more productive you are, right?</p>
 
<p>However, these measures can have unintended consequences.  Measuring call duration or number of calls handled per day can lead to call center agents rushing through calls just to meet their targets.  This can lead to customers having to call back multiple times to resolve their issues, ultimately leading to a worse customer experience and lower productivity, even though according to the statistics productivity has gone up.</p>

<p>By its very nature, a call centre is designed to handle non-standard
calls. Outliers and corner cases, or those questions that hasn't been answered yet. It is typically the use cases used by a select few or in a non-average configuration. If it was possible to answer the questions easily and quickly, chances are it could easily be automated or handled by a chatbot. </p>

<p>Call-centres are intended to deal with corner cases. Their goal
should be to improve the customer experience by providing information that is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> available in the system. It is supposed to
be a listening tool to find out what the customers need in order to
deliver better quality products. A barometer to measure the external
environment.</p>
<p><strong><em>By measuring the number of calls handled per day, or the
duration of each call, ultimately you are saying that it is acceptable
to build bad software (or products).</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than compromising the quality by reducing the time spent on
each support call, the goal should be to deliver value (or quality) by
balancing time, cost and scope to meet the sole objective of meeting
customer expectations, which is what quality essentially is about.</p>
<p>It’s not perceived quality when you offer a customer a more expensive
solution with all the bells and whistles that he doesn’t need or want,
just as it isn’t perceived quality when a car salesman offers a Ferrari
because it’s the most expensive option on the floor to someone looking
for cost-effective and family friendly. No one would argue that the
Ferrari is a high-quality vehicle, but it doesn’t meet the needs of the
customer, making it worthless. It is only quality when what you offer
meets the needs and wants of the customer. That is quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quality is not what’s better for you. Quality is what’s better for
the customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Improving productivity directly relates to improving quality. Quality
directly relates to the value delivered. High quality, high
productivity.</p>
<p>Re-evaluate whether your measures support higher productivity by
enabling faster delivery of value, or whether it impedes a great user
experience. Just because a customer answers that their call was
sufficiently dealt with by the call centre agent, doesn’t mean that they
are happy with the service or product offering. The only questions that
really matter are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Would you use the service or product again?</em></li>
<li><em>Would you recommend the service or product to someone
else?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than measuring the number of calls handled per day or the time
spent on each call, measure the categories of calls and the number of
similar issues reported. Use it as an input into the design and
development function rather than a fire fighting mechanism to shield the
developers from the errors they made.</p>
<h2 id="youre-doing-too-much">3. You’re doing too much</h2>
<p>More is better. Right?</p>
<p>Well, I would argue that in most cases this is not true at all.
Apple, being the perfect example to prove that it’s not about how much
functionality there is, but how useful that functionality is. Good
design is simple. It’s easy to understand. It doesn’t require you to
read through a manual or attend a training course to use it. It doesn’t
require someone constantly having to show you how to do the same thing
or where to find it.</p>
<p><img
src="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/funficient-quality-triangle.jpg" /></p>
<p>The one axis of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">quality
triangle</a> is scope, yet few productivity improvement suggestions
focus on this aspect. Cost and time improvements are covered in detail,
yet few people realize that scope can be reduced too to improve
productivity. It’s not only about doing more with fewer resources, but
it is also simply about doing less.</p>
<p>One of the deadly <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2018/10/10/why-lean-business-methodologies-can-help-your-business-thrive/">wastes
of lean</a> is overproduction. Producing more functions than what is
used is a waste. It is scientifically proven that the human brain can
only hold 3 – 8 items in working memory. When you open up a program like
Adobe Illustrator with it’s multitude functions, it can be overwhelming
and daunting. Research has also proven that most users only use the same
few functions, with up to 80% of software development unused. Imagine
what you could have done with the time spent on these 80% unused
functions if you weren’t so busy building it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The customer isn’t always right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a difference between blindly saying yes to a customer
request and understanding the need behind this request. Often, you are
serving the customer better by saying no. Many times customers will ask
for a specific function to be built. Yet after finding out why they want
this or how they intend to use it, it often becomes clear that they
either don’t need it, or they want something else than what they asked
for. They just don’t know the technical language you are speaking.
Saying yes to every customer requirement is not adding to the value
delivered and can negatively impact productivity.</p>
<p>Rather than measuring the number of features developed, measure how
users are using it to decide whether something is actually productive or
not.</p>
<h2 id="productivity-improvements-pay-for-itself">Productivity
improvements pay for itself</h2>
<p>More productive teams translate to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2015/04/15/purpose-profit/">higher
profit margin</a>s for the company. Investing in productivity
improvement is an investment, rather than an expense.</p>
<p>To start your journey to more productive teams, make sure you are
measuring the right thing, and that you measure it rights by comparing
apples to apples and including an end-to-end view of the process.
Lastly, learn to say no. Less is more. Discern between what a customer
is asking for and what they actually need to <a
href="https://peopledevelopmentmagazine.com/2022/05/03/productivity-habits/">achieve
their goal</a>.</p>
<p>Spend more time understanding the need before rushing to build
it.</p>

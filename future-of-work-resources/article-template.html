  "description": "Psychological safety is the foundation of high-performing teal organizations. Learn how trust, fairness, and growth unlock innovation and engagement.",
  "articleBody": "Psychological safety is the foundation of high-performing teams and organizations. It describes a shared belief that people can speak openly, ask questions, admit mistakes, and challenge ideas without fear of humiliation, punishment, or exclusion. Research consistently shows that when psychological safety is present, creativity, engagement, learning, and productivity increase, while burnout and turnover decrease.\n\nThe concept was popularized by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson and validated by large-scale research such as Google’s Project Aristotle, which found psychological safety to be the single most important factor distinguishing high-performing teams from low-performing ones. Importantly, psychological safety does not mean avoiding conflict or lowering standards. Instead, it enables constructive disagreement, accountability, and continuous improvement.\n\nPsychological safety can be understood as a layered system with three core levels. The first level is material security, which includes fair pay, job stability, and equitable treatment. Without this foundation, people naturally shift into self-protection rather than contribution. The second level is voice and participation, where everyone has equal permission to speak up regardless of role, seniority, or background. Clear decision-making processes and transparent roles are essential at this stage. The third level is growth and learning, where people feel safe to admit uncertainty, learn from mistakes, and develop openly.\n\nAs organizations move toward more autonomous, decentralized, and self-managing models, psychological safety becomes increasingly essential. In these environments, performance depends on trust, honest communication, and shared responsibility rather than control. Psychological safety enables organizations to access their employees’ full intelligence and adaptability, making it a critical foundation for the future of work and for successful teal organizational transformations.",

      <p>Safety is the foundational prerequisite to any high-performing team. When there is adequate psychological safety in the workplace, employee wellness, creativity, innovation, and productivity all increase, while burnout and turnover decrease.

Learn how this connects to <a class="internal-link" href="/future-of-work-resources.html">teal organizations and the future of work</a>, where trust replaces control.</p>

Psychological safe environments also tend to attract and retain top talent, further amplifying the positive benefits of an environment strongly founded in trust and respect. In environments where people feel safe to contribute honestly, organizations gain access to their employees’ full intelligence — not just their compliance.</p>

  <h2>What is psychological safety?</h2>

  <p>The term “psychological safety” was popularized by Harvard Business School professor <a class="external-link" href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6451" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Amy Edmondson's Bio (opens in a new tab)">Amy Edmondson</a>, who defines it as “a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.” In practical terms, this means people feel able to speak up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes without fear of being embarrassed, rejected, or punished.</p>

  <p>Psychological safety does not mean avoiding conflict, lowering standards, or always being comfortable. It also doesn't mean anarchy, chaos, and everyone getting away with whatever they say or do.  Rather, it creates an environment where people can challenge each other constructively and learn from failure. High psychological safety enables high accountability.</p>

  <h2>The basic levels of psychological safety</h2>

  <p>Psychological safety can be understood as a layered system, much like a set of nested russian dolls.  Each layer provides the stability required for the next level of growth. When any layer is weak, people retreat into self-protection instead of contribution.  There are three core levels in this hierarchy of psychological safety needs:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="article-list"><strong>Material security</strong> – fair pay, job security, tools</li>
    <li class="article-list"><strong>Voice and participation</strong> – equal permission to contribute</li>
    <li class="article-list"><strong>Growth and learning</strong> – safety to learn from mistakes</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each layer builds on the previous.  A strong foundation requires that companies address the needs in the first layer before moving onto the next.  It starts with meeting the "selfish" personal needs, before moving onto the needs of individuals within the group in an interdependency, finally moving towards mutual growth and expansion where everyone moves forward, together.  If only one person's safety needs are met, the company can not move forward.  You are essentially as weak as your weakest link in the organization.</p>

  <h3>Level 1 – Material needs are met</h3>

  <p>The foundation of psychological safety is economic and material security. People must trust that they will be paid adequately and reliably, treated fairly, and given the tools they need to do their work. According to the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-at-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="World Health Organization article (opens in a new tab)">World Health Organization</a>, job insecurity and unfair treatment are major contributors to workplace anxiety, depression, and disengagement.</p>

  <p>When employees fear losing their income, benefits, or status, they naturally withhold their true thoughts. They stop pointing out risks, inefficiencies, or ethical problems — and instead quietly start looking for a new job.</p>

  <p>In traditional organizations, contracts are usually designed to protect the employer. For psychological safety to exist, employment agreements must be experienced as fair by both sides. If an employer has the right to end a contract, employees must also legally leave without retaliation, punishment or stigma. This mutual power balance creates the trust required for honest communication.</p>

  <h3>Level 2 – Everyone participates with freedom and equality</h3>

  <p>The second level of psychological safety is the freedom to think and speak without fear. This means people can express opinions, raise concerns, and offer ideas regardless of rank, seniority, or background.</p>

  <p>Most traditional workplaces operate with invisible hierarchies of voice: the higher someone’s title or salary, the safer they feel speaking and the more their opinion is valued. Research from <a class="external-link" href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Gallup research findings article (opens in a new tab)">Gallup</a> shows that when employees do not feel heard engagement, innovation, and loyalty collapse.</p>

  <p>True psychological safety does not mean every person has equal decision-making authority or that everyone must democratically agree before a decision is exercised — it means every person has equal permission to contribute. A junior employee must be just as free to challenge a flawed idea or suggest a new idea as a senior executive.</p>

  <p>This requires clear, inclusive decision-making processes, transparent roles, and explicit expectations. When people know how decisions are made and how their voice fits into the system, they no longer need to protect themselves politically.</p>

  <h3>Level 3 – Support to grow and evolve</h3>

  <p>The highest level of psychological safety is the freedom to be authentic and honest, especially when they don't know the answer or made a mistake. In a psychologically safe organization, people are allowed to admit uncertainty, ask for help, and learn in public.</p>

  <p>Amy Edmondson’s research shows that teams with high psychological safety report more errors — not because they make more mistakes, but because they feel safe enough to talk about them. This transparency allows teams to learn faster, innovate more, and prevent small problems from becoming large failures.  By bringing errors to the surface early, it prevents costly mistakes from being discovered by a customer.</p>

  <p>When people are supported in their personal and professional development, work becomes a partnership instead of a transaction. Growth replaces fear. Curiosity replaces defensiveness. This is the foundation of high-trust, self-managing organizations.</p>

  <h2>Why psychological safety is essential for the future of work</h2>

  <p>As organizations move toward flatter, more autonomous, and more distributed structures, psychological safety becomes even more important. In teal organizations, decision-making is decentralized, meaning people must be willing to speak up, challenge assumptions, and take ownership.</p>

  <p>Without psychological safety, self-management collapses into silence and hidden conflict. With it, organizations gain resilience, adaptability, and collective intelligence.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Psychological safety enables authenticity, learning, and autonomy. It rests on mutual trust and the belief that everyone’s dignity, insight, and contribution matter.</p>

  <p>This is why psychological safety is foundational to <a class="internal-link" href="/future-of-work-resources/the-essence-of-productivity.html">true productivity and to any successful teal transformation</a>.</p>
